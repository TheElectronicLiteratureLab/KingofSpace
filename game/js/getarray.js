"It is a  place of unimaginable emptiness. In 690 billion square miles, only three asteroids can support a Class A town: Pallas the Whorehouse,  Circe the prison, and Ceres the Bureaucracy. From these three asteroids, hidden  behind  glass screens  and virus filters, the Terran administrators try to hold a territory  larger than all of the empire. <br>  <br> The Independent Trading Colonies scratch out a living in Beltspace. Each ITC supports perhaps 50 to 100 humans. But between the ITCs and the three, there is emptiness, desertion, and silence. <br> <br>50 years ago, it was different.  But then the Incarnations came, the Priestess and the Red King…  <br> <br> And after them, the Plague…",// 1

"Year 919 of the Empire. On his dying spaceboat,  Tam Ross dreams… <br> <br>He is back on ITC 3502, curled up  in the sleeping pod he shares with his mother. His mother is a very important person,  a watchman at the WaterCenter. Their pod hangs by the big water tanks. <br><br> He is an important person too. <br> <br> He cracks  open the sleeping pod and sniffs the cool fresh air. The auxiliary lights flicker dimly. The sunlights are still off. In a tiny spotlight, the sacred puppet of  the Rice Emperor dances in the wind from the air vents.", //2 (corner image)

"Tam touches the edge of the sleeping pod and wiggles out the seam. The cool damp air raises goosebumps on his skin. He runs over the prickly- grassed nutrient floor and climbs up the ladder to the biggest tank. <br> <br>He jumps in and begins swimming among the koi,  in the cold early-morning water, and the big fish rub their bodies against his and kiss him, asking for food.", // 3 (sleeping pod image ?) 

"But in the dream, the Rice Emperor reaches up to his puppet frame and breaks the strings that hold him. He strides across the air toward Tam, across the surface of the water. He stands on the water, glaring with rage, pointing at Tam, and the Imperial Soldiers surround them. <br><br> <i>'Blasphemer! Traitor!' </i> <br><br> He grabs Tam tight by the left hand and draws his fingernail across the complex gene-tattoo that covers Tam's palm. The tattoo that shows his plague resistance. The pain claws at Tam's chest and he cannot breath. the gene-tattoo bubbles and burst.", //4(corner image)

"He wakes up gasping. <br> <br>The oxygen depletion alarm is wailing. Every gasp is a knife in his lungs. <br><br> He cannot remember for a moment which auxiliary oxygen tanks are still unused. He flicks switches clumsily with his left hand.  <br><br> One tank left.",//6

"His eyes blur as he tries to read nav charts. He is only twenty-tree but his hands shake as he keys in chart coordinates. <br> <br> He remembers his dream and smiles mirthlessly. They burned his hand on Pallas, trying to make him give names of the others who were trying to breed Plague resistance. Some Priestess's slave-King burned the gene tattoo off his palm, skin, nerves  and all. He clenches and unclenches it, holding his anger in his bad hand. <br> <br> There is no inhabited asteroid within a halfmonth, not even a miner's claim. And he has less that a shipday worth of air.", //7

"The radar beacon has locked on to something. <br> <br>Barely visible, a shadow-shape blocks the stars. <br><br> <i>Eternal Mother!</i> - it's a ship. An old one, and huge. <br> <br> It's the size of a Class A town, a great irregular cloud of modules and environments, furred with the junk of a thousand System journeys, revolving around itself in a vast complexity of orbits. At its edges he can see the stars though the cloud, but in its center the pods swarm so thickly that the ship looks like a single vast solid object. <br> <br> And it is dark. No lights shine from it: no red warning lamps, no yellow haze of sunlights.",//8

The little white moon can restock an entire planet. <br><br> It can restock a Greatship.",//11

" But there will be a crew. <br><br> A Priestess and her Red King. The chief Imperial servants in the Asteroids. <br> <br>The Priestess with her powers controls life and death in the Rocks.

"She is encased in a half moon of ice, and sparkles of silver ray out from her body. Her skin is the dusky color of twilight  on the Fertile Worlds, and on it, faintly, glow stars. Piercing her right ear is a silver earring in the shape of a sickle moon.", // 14

"The Priestess. But there is no Red King with her. <br><br> Tam's head echoes with the warm bass tones of the Scriptures he heard as a child and no longer believes in. <br><br> &emsp; <i>The Emperor mated with Terra, and their Daughter was Space.<br> &emsp; Space is a virgin whose skin is dark and whose body is coverd with <br> &emsp; stars. The moon hangs in her ear. In her womb are all the seeds of life...</i><br><br> The halo of silver seeds extends through the ice around her. In that gel is the genetic code of everything from algae to humans. On Venus, criminals  kill to get algae. Algae make oxygen; you can eat algae. With algae you can  live. <br><br> Where is her Red King?",//15

"Where is the poor bastard? <br><br> &emsp; <i> Because she was lonely for a lover, she made a man out of Mars-dust, and by concours with her in the ceremony he gaind life.

"He sould be on the couch,<br>  frozen in the coldsleep gel<br> with her.",//17

"Tam's neck chills. This Priestess is still wearing the Virgin's Moon. <br><br> Her earring is a thin sickle of silver, a virgin's earring. Until she shairs her earring, she has no powers.<br><br> The Priestesses  get their ''powers'' through computer linkage, and the linking-up happens during the sharring. A Priestess on her virgin voyage finds a man and mates with him. After sex, she  gets  her powers. Sex is magic.<br><br> But during the sex- this is a bad religion- the Priestess infects her lover with  the most virulent form of Plague. Whoever she finds, the poor bastard becomes her Red King. Her bodyguard. Totally, fanatically, dedicated to her. <br><br> Mated to Space? No. Mated to her. For life.",//18

"Tam Rosse looks down at his red prison jumpsuit and grins wryly. The Red King.<br> &emsp; <i> And all who love the Emperer's Saughter shall know and love the Emperor.</i> <br> He makes his sacred left hand into  a fist. Nothing makes him love the Emperor. But he needs the Priestess's knowledge.",//19

//21 ch1 The Ceremony ritual is just an excuse; removing the earring is the key to her powers. He'll try that, then talk with her rationally.

"Tam Rosses reaches through the ''ice '' and tries to slip the earring out of her ear. <br><br> It  won't move. <br><br> The half-mmon  of ice turns into water, rivulets flowing down into the surface of the egg-ship. There is a flash of great hear, a warmth and wetness. Tam Rosse breaks into a sweat. The girl opens her eyes and reaches  up her  hand  to her ear. <br><br> Her eyes are utterly black. <br><br>  Is the Ceremony all rational? look into her eyes...  ",//20

"She looks around her, confused still stunned from the coldsleep drugs. It has been such a long dreaming. Standing over her is a man in red. <br> ''-You?'' the man in red says. <br><br> You... The word is strange. It means her. She looks tentatively down at her arms, at her naked breasts. Her skin is dark and across it are freckled little stars. Funny. They mean something. So does his red suit. She thinks of a pary- something- St. Nicholsun's Days on Pallas. ''Are you Saint Nicholsun?'' she says triumphantly.<br><br> She can fell his eyes like a rough hand on her skin. He turns away. ''You've lost your  memory. It happens sometimes in cold sleep,'' he  says. ''You'll get it back.'' " ,//21

"''I know who I am,'' she says. '' I'm Aster. I'm supposed to go to a party. it's called the Ceremony.'' <br><br> She  looks down at her body again. All over she is shaped like a grownup. She frowns. She touches she strange round breasts. They bob and tug as she gets up, and there is some king of ID stud in her ear, something that hurts and tingles. They have something to do with the party.<br><br> She is afraid of the Ceremony, somehow.<br><br> ''Lets look in the ship,''  the man says.",//22

"He goes in front of her, Propelling himself down a snaky corridor. It is dark and she is afraid. she asks him to wait for her while she looks for a suit, but he tells her she dosen't need one. '' Not you. Your're spacehabbed.'' <br><br> ''What does that mean?'' <br><br> ''It means you're important,'' he says roughly. ''Almost as good as a Terran.'' <br><br> He takes her by the arm and leads her down the cooridor. In  his other hand he holds some kind of dagger, like a dress-up for St. Nicholsun's. He gesturees to the lock. <br><br> There are frost-flowers around the massive old doors. She remembers not to touch frosted metal, but to put her hand only on the touchplate.",//23

"Her fingers seem to work by themselves, and through the metal of the ship they feel a vibration. <br><br> The lock-picture makes a pattern and the door unlocks for her. <br><br> It's nice feeling, like a tickling, like a koi kissing her hand. <br><br> She feels the ship somehow. She almost smells it.",//24

"Inside the airlock waits an old, old man.",//30

"Bugs crawl in his hair and his skin is yellow-gray. Even in the thin air by the airlock, he smells like old dirt. <br><br> But he is a captain, because he has an wire crown on his head. <br><br> ''I am king,'' he says, staring at Aster. <br><br> His red jumpsuit, stiff with dirt, hangs on his body. He scratches at his withered crotch. He plucks at the Imperial name-patch and looks at it curiousley as though it is the instructions for a machine he does not use. <br><br> ''I am King Brady.'' ",//29

"''Priestess?'' The old man says. He looks at her strangely. <br><br> ''No,'' she says. ''Aster. Not a Priestess.'' Priestesses are grownups.<br><br> ''You folks tradin''? <br><br> Trade? She looks more closely at the dirty old man.",//30

"She knows about trade. Trade means presents. <br><br> When the trading ships come  in,  a little girl on  Pall'  can get a present just by asking. <br><br> ''Will you give me a present?'' she asks the old man.<br><br> The old man laughs strangely <br><br> ''Honey, I'll do you a favor.''",//31

"''You can't do that!'' the other man yells.''She's lost her memory.''<br><br> ''shut up boy. She asked. I got some wine,'' the old man says.''Huney, you ever tasted wine?'' <br><br> No, she has never tasted wine. How could she at four years old? The old man  sets the strange candle down. The quavering light speckles the top of a dust-covered storcube and glimmers on something more wonderful than she has ever seen.<br><br> The metal of the cup has a sheen, all over, like her own skin. The cup is heacy, covered with crystals that spark like stars on her sin. She picks it up, delighted. <br><br> The other man tries to knock it away from her!",//32

"''Who picks it up drinks it,'' the oldman says. ''That's part of Ceremony. Hey?'' <br><br> She doesn’t know what he means, but she drinks from the cup. <br><br> The wine is strange, choking. She coughs. It tastes of incense. <br><br> Incense... the smell of bodies together, a crowd...<br><br> Barefooted on the swirl-patterned steel of the Palladion, a  crowd of girls, Priestess-virgins, practicing for  the Ceremony, tasting  the wine. Taste of plums and fermentation, cumin, nutmeg, cannabis, the sting of the alcohol against the roof of the mouth...<br><br> She remembers.",//33

"The cup loosens from her hand and drops.<br><br> And the old man, snatching it from  her, drinks the last drops of the cup. <br><br><br> ''No!'' she cries.", //34

"The old man holds out his hand.  His nails are black ridged claws. Between his fingers are seams of dirt. ''Take your King's hand,'' he says. She shudders back.<br><br> The young man protests.  '' She didn't remember. You forced a favor on her.''  <br><br> ''No force, boy.'' <br><br> She turns to look at the man in red. The young man, the fertile man. She can hardly bear to look at him without touching him. <br><br> To have given herself to the other one is blasphemy. He is too old to be fertile. Mother Eternal, what will she do?",//35

"And she doesn't have her powers until - How can a priestess make fertility, until her own body is a seed? <br><br> ''You can't be my King,'' she gasps to the old man. <br><br> Her breast and groin ache and the silver earring weighs heavy in her ear.<br><br> ''Well, girl, s'pose we try.''",//36

"She turns and takes the young man's hand. She holds it desperately, not daring to look at him, feeling only his tight strength. <br><br> How can her word be as important as her life?<br><br> ''I  have given you a favor. I will fix hour ship.  Give me this man for servant.''<br><br> Her body confuses her with its longing. <br><br> The old man looks at her shrewdly. <br><br> ''He'll serve  you in the day,'' he says.  ''But in the night, I.''",//37

"He starts to repair the Water Center. <br><br> The big transparent water-globes are chocked with dying algae. The sunlights have dimmed, flickering, dying. The filters leak water onto the nutrient floor.<br><br> She has only half her powers. The ship needs more knowledge than she has, and  the silver earringhangs heavy in her ear.",//38

"She sends Tam Rosse to look for new filters. <br><br> Servant. Her servant. <br><br> Eyes follow them everywhere.<br><br> Stationaly cameras, skittering watch bots. A spyfly crawls over her ear, looking at the earring. <br><br> They are like flies on the bodies of the dead.",//39 pic of the watercenter  

"At night she goes to Brady. <br><br>  She closes her eyes and endures. But at the end she is as she was before and the silver sickle earring will not drop form her ear. <br><br> In the dark, she plants seeds in the nutrient floor, but nothing growns under her hands. <br><br> Only the Ceremony plant.",//40

"The first shipday, the Ceremony plant is as high as her belly. <br><br> ''Give me a favor from that plant,'' Tam Rosse says. <br><br> She gives him  the smallest of the unfurling green leaves. He kneels and holds it in his hand, a green thing  in all this dead grayness. He looks at her and their eyes meet while they might count one. <br><br> What good is her word on this dying ship?<br><br> Thy clean the old filters. Thy find in them the skeletons of koi. She re-balances the chemistry of the hydroponics garden. <br><br> That night. Brady comet o her, but he cannot take the earring from her ear.",//41

"The next shipday the Ceremony plant is as high as her heart. <br><br> ''Give me a favor from that plant,'' Tam Rosse says again.<br><br> She gives him a branch with a spray of green leaces. He  holds it in his hand, and they smells the scent of its life in the dead and decay-smelling ship. Tam Rosses looks at her, and their eyes meen while they might count three. <br><br> What good is her word? It was tricked from her. ",//42

"They clean dead algae from the tanks. Tam Rosse fixes valves and clears a pipe. They start the aerator in the big open tank. They water runs blear but dead. <br><br>  They look at it together and do not look at eachother. They say nothing.<br><br> That night Brady comet to her, but he cannot take the earring from her ear.<br><br>''Let me go to him,'' she pleads with the old man.<br><br>''Girl, I been waiting so long. Trained to be a Red King. You chose  me.''<br><br> He smells of dust and rotten onions. He is flabby and limp. He is old.",//43

"On the third shipday the Ceremony plant is as high as her silver earring. <br><br> ''Give me a favor from that plant,''  Tam Rosses says again.<br><br> The Ceremony flowers have opened, red soft funnels of flower in around whirl of leaves. Their scent is like a summer night on the Fertile Worlds. <br><br> The buzz she hears could be insects in those summer fields; but it is a spyfly. Does the ship control them, or does King Brady? Which of them can hear whatever she says?",//44

"The aerator monitors in the Water Center pound like hearts. She is the heart of the ship, and it  beats, it beats. <br><br> ''A favor?''  she asks, and gives Tam Rosses...",//45

"She snatches the spyfly out of the air. ''Go tell your master I brock my word!'' she whispers to it and crushes it. <br><br> And there is no buzz in the air,  no summer fields, only the scent of Ceremony flowers, and of him, ''I give you all my favor,'' she mummers in to his ear. The red Ceremony blossoms fall on them as they lie under the tree. The red is the color of his discarded jumpsuit, and she laughs, drunk with joy, as they lie together.  <br><br> She draws her  fingers across  his  palm and his wound  heals. <br><br>He loosens the silver earring form  her earlobe. <br><br> She is the ship and the ship is living. The ship is a speck in her  belly and she is lying with her lover in t he belly of the ship.",//46

"When she wakes up it is snowing in the ship.<br><br>  The plants are growing underneath the snow. The snow dazzles at the edges; it is illusion. <br><br> But  it is a cruel illusion, a strong one. Ice forms on the water-tanks. The koi struggle as the water greexes. The great tanks strain and crack, and a cold wind screams as the doors iris open.",//47

"The Priestess finds herself standing  in a hall made of ice. The wind keens through the ship as  if  the steel of the ship is crying. <br><br>''Oh my  lover! The  Captain is dead.'' <br><br> A red-clothed man lies dead on  a bier. He is pale all over, blue with cold. <br><br>Oh my lover! <br><br> But it is King Brady.",//48

"A woman stands over him, an old Japanese woman. Her hair whirls around her, Ice-crystals and now. Her kimono is broken mirrors, the sing of unfaithfulness.<br><br> ''I an the Lady Nii,'' says the Ship.<br><br> ''Your King is dead,'' says the Lady Nill,  raising her wrinkled face. ''My Captain-lover of many  years waited for you, Priestess. When you came you would not have him.You took a young lover. My Captain, my lover died of a broken heart.''",//49

"The Ship passes her wrinkled palm across the dead mans hair. She lifts the power crown frim his dead forehead. <br><br> ''I am linked to you  now,'' the Priestess says. ''We both carry life because of the Ceremony.''<br><br>  The old woman recoils. She passes her  fan across the Priestess's stomach, and her fan is made of broken mirrors.",//50

"''Your lover has left you a child, and you want to make gardens in my belly. Your child will necer nurse form me or wear the powercrown. Your lover is the dung in  your  gardens, and your child shall  die, and  you will starve while your gardens crumble to dust.'' <br><br> the old woman puts the power crown on her own wild hait. <br><br> ''I am steel. Why do I need gardens? I will support human life no more.''",//51

"In the Water Center it is cold.",//55

"Nii dose not speak to her, not even through illusions. <br><br> The ship's grief is like a steel wall",//53

"From this steel winter, The Priestess forces spring. <br><br> She programs the local computer to rotate the sunlights<br><br> The cold retreats. <br><br> Her hands shape the nutriment around the sprouts, balance the chemistry of the water gardens. In the smaller tanks, algae drift. Nori ripple their wide leaves into the cold salt water.",//54

"Food and air grow under her hands. Shrimp, kelp, plankton, oranges, sunfood, breadfruit. Ripe tomatos with  their dust-smellignleaces. Beans and green clover, that keep the nitrogen in the soil and give her air to breath. <br><br> The Priestess's child pushes upward in her womb, marking the days.",//55

"Sometimes she cannot tell herself from the ship.<br><br> Tam has put seeds in both their wombs, and the ship is breeding fish, her womb is full of food, air, flowers. She is her own lifeship, a round mountain, a seedling, a waxing planet.",//56

"One day, as  the Priestess swims  in the tank, she feels a wave that starts in her belly. It is  pain and excitement at once. She rides it, panting. <br><br> There are handles at the side of the tank. She grasps  them and  floats in the water, bracing herself against the waves. <br><br> One by one she rides them and they course through her body, pulling at her like the moon. She si opening  herself like a ripe fruit. The leaves come closer and closer together, more quickly, higher, immense. She is enormous, fragile, as tenuous as Mars' atmosphere, streching over the living planet of ther baby.",//57

"And Death comes walking toward her across the waves.<br><br> Death is a belly full of nightmares, a belly that bulges and twists under gray skin. Waves slap painfully against the Priestess's straining womb. The Koi rise to the surface and kiss Death's feet, and shudder and float on the surface. Brown water pumps out of Death's womb in to irrigation system and the brownness spreads in the the plants and turns them sickly and yellow. Their leaves droop. <br><br> ''Healer,'' says Death, ''did you forgetme?''",//58

"The waves come form outside her now, faster, faster, she can't breathe, they won't stop long enough for her to breath. <br><br>Death grabs her in muscular arms, holds her against Deaths taut belly, womb to womb. Death's heavy-laboring belly tightens, tightens, and the Priestess screams but the tightness spreads over her belly too, she is choking, drowning, splitting apart. <br><br> The water draws back  from her, roaring and the final wave of pain comes, hangs over her head, her whole body convulses with the pain and the fear of it, and then the wave hits, all at once, and tumbles her to darkness.",//59

"She is  floating  in something liquid, cradling, warm. She opens her eyes. A tiny koi swims past, gold-scailed snd gold-finned, blurry in the water; It swivels around on itself and returns to kiss at her skin. She is in the WaterCenter, floating in the big open tank. The sunlights are woking. <br><br> She crawls out of the tank. She is the first land animal that  ever was, weak and clumsy. Exhausted, she sits on the nutrient floor, feeling  her body, running water-wrinkled hands over brests and belly. Her breast are painful but not much swollen yet. Her nipples are still a virgi's soft comes. Behind her groin-bone she can barely feel the hard ball of her womb, rising like a baby's fist. <br><br> The Nii has given her illusions to frighten her.  <br><br> Months yet  before  she bears  her child.",//60

"But still Nii, the Lady Nii, stands above her, wearing her kimono of broken glass. Nii slaps her naked lup-swollen belly,  where nightnars crawl under the skin. The old woman squats down, rubbing at her back as if she is about to  birth  her nightnares. She squints at the Priestess. <br><br> ''Fertility,'' she says, ''is your excuse for everything. You humans spread like a virus out of your planet. You infected your own moon, Venus, Mars. You came out here to the Asteroids, where you can barely live. <br><br> ''To reproduce yourselves here, you humans had to carry your genes ouside your bodies. You had to trade genes, calculate which to combine to keep your colonies going. Your gene pool got infected, so you humans cut it like a sore away form your bodies. And you left all your infected  here to die. You have no morality. You brace only this sickness of life.''",//61

"''You killed my Captain-lover form grief because he was not fertile, and took another man only because he was. <br><br>''You created me to be your servant. You infect me. I have lived with you so long, I am leprosied by you.''",//62

"''Priestess, you are not steel; you will die. I know yourfears. Every night your guard will be down, I will come in to your mind as you read mine, I will paint pictues on your nerves. Last night's was a kiss.''<br><br> ''I will tell you about breast cancer and wombs that dry up. I will tell you about children  that  die  and children thay hate. I  will say that your lover does not love you,  does not  want to serve your body; that he will take a ship one day and go to fight in a bigger ear. You  will belive  me  more  every day. I will say he loves power and hates you. I will make you smell shit form the diesease that kills you. Your tounge will tast the sourness of your dying. Fertile Priestess, every flower that frows under  your hand will be a fear.''",//63

"The Priestess reaches over, a little clumsily because the balance of her body is already changing, and brushes her fingers over the low sprouts of her  garden. <br><br> ''Fool,'' says Nii. The old woman rubs ner belly and small monsters birth form her, slither down her legs like poisonous  liquid.  Their claws scrabble away the nurtient floor  and  uproot  the seedlings; thorough the torn floor the steel shines. <br><br> The Priestess take a deep breath. Though the distruction she can see the garden undisturbed.''Your illusions do not frighten  me.''<br><br> Nii grunt and pushes to her feet. Her protruding belly still writhes. She spreads her legs. An immense redness gushes out of her. <br><br> A man, red-clothed, limp. It  is Tam Rosse. ",//64

"The Priestess cries out and kneels by Tam.<br><br> The Nii is nothing now but a mirror, a reflection crowned with a crown of gold wires. She shakes the  power crown down like some strange fruit onto Tam;shead. <br><br> ''Here is your  Captain. I birthed him like a child. I have given him the power crown, and he will take power from you. He will not trust you because  you are part of the Empire. In the end he will run form you, scorning the food and the are you have given him, the children you bear, because he knows you did not choose anything you have done. <br><br>''You are programmed, in your genes and your fertility, and he knows it.'' ",//65

"Nii vanishes. <br><br> They are alone, in the Water Center. The Priestess sits, Tam's head cradled in her lap. In her belly, the child is  already a third peron with them.<br><br> Who will the child be? Aster of Pallas, a four-year-old girl, who snatched at a cup of wine? A girl who knew on oldman's life counted less thatn a lover's? A woman who can choose nightmares? For a momne she looks around in panic. <br><br> What drives up? What made us cme to this empty place, these steel walls, to drive ourselves in to the airless belly of space? <br><br> But this is not a question she can ask of steel. ",//66

"A moment of darkness, and Tam finds himself in the Great Hall. In the middle of it, standing face to face, are three people, two women and a man. <br><br> The first priestess. <br><br> The second looks like Tam. Is this an illusion, or Brady, or himself? <br><br> The third is a straight-backed old japanese woman, dressed in a magnificent kimono dyed with flowers. Tam can see the steel robot faintly beneath the glow of her clear skin and the pattern of her robe. <br><br> The old woman turns toward him. ''I am Nii.''",

"''You're an illusion,'' he says. <br><br> She smiles and bows. In the dyed flowers of her kimono hover hummingbirds sewn from golden thread. <br><br>The man who looks like Tam is throwing his body from side to side in front of the Priestess. The Priestess turns her head to look at him. <br><br> ''What's he doing?'' Tam asks the Priestess. <br><br> ''He is dancing,'' Nii replies. ''An illusion of dancing. For the Emperor and Terra.'' <br><br>''He shouldn't look like me. Give me back my body,'' Tam says to the Priestess.",

"''Which body do you want, old man, young man? When in your life is the body that is yours? What part of it is yours, and not mine, or his, or hers?'' <br><br> Nii draws from her obi a simple dancing fan. She snaps it ope and shows him both sides. One side is gilded, showing the sun, a hummingbird, a spray of goldenrod. The other is silvered, showing the moon, a mirror, a trickle of water.",

"She fans the silver side at him, and he is standing in rotting trash, an old man, bent, cramped with pain, in a broken control room. <br><br> She fans the golden side at him, and he has his own body again, but he is dressed in red Ceremony robes and standing in a vaulted rich place, A crowd of people press around him holding candles, and the walls are mirrored as far as he can see.",

"''Illusions, Tam Rosse,'' the Nii murmurs. <br><br> The silver side fans at him. He is an old man wearing a glowing white skintite thick with insulation. A flag floats in the low gravity: the flag of the Free Asteroids. <br><br> ''Will the uprising succeed? Will we be free?'' <br><br> ''You scorn illusions'' smiles the Nii, ''but you talk about freedom.'' <br><br> She fans him again, This time the fan is red. He is standing facing the Priestess, in Brady's place. The Lady Nii stands beside them. King Brady is lying on the floor, and another Nii kneels beside him.",

"''No more illutions!'' Tam Rosse says. <br><br> The fan is black, like the broken pods in the Central Storage. It is dim and dusty like the drydock. The old man twitches in pain on the floor. The Priestess stands by him, young and pale, not with her powers and never to get them, and beside her stands a dented guard-robot holding a piece of broken metal in the shape of a fan. <br><br> The old lady Nii holds out her left hand, palm up. Her palm is broad, small, creased with many lines. On it is a single winged seed. The seed is an obvious illusion. Its edges shimmer faintly as if it is not quite in synch with the illusion of the Nii. <br><br> She shakes her left hand in the air and the seed flies, many seeds fly through the air, glowing.",

"Somebody's trying to get his attention. All Tam wants to do is snuggle up against the nice soft laser cannon. <br><br> But there's a sound like a re-entry vehicle throttling right beside his ear. The roar ricochets around Tam's skull, shredding neurons as it goes. <br><br> It's somebody. . . speaking. . .  Why would anybody want to say anything, when a man needs to sleep? <br><br> ''This is Lady Nii. . .Please proceed to the Ceremony'' <br><br> ''Oh, go away''",

"Somebody sits crosslegged next to him. he groans and curls uptighter. <br><br> ''Look, Tam baby'' it's his old political advisor in the Cadre, John Goorey. Goorey is wearing the same loud, tasteless sweater. ''The first duty of a political man is to survive. Why don't you play along with the Priestess? She has agenda but she sympathizes. there are disaffected people inside the Empire, you know.'' <br><br> Tam Rosse sits upright. His skull comes completely loose, caroms around the airlock, strikes painfully against several large and heavy objects, and miraculously comes to rest balancing on top of his neck. Tam clutches the top of his head to keep it from getting away again. ''You're just an illusion,'' he informs Goorey. ''And what's more. You. Are. Drunk.'' <br><br> Goorey giggles and a star fluoresces briefly on his forehead before he disappears.",

"The air shimmers. An old Japanese women stands in front og him. <br><br> She bows. <br><br> ''OK, who are you?'' <br><br> ''I am Nii, please. Spirit of the ship.''

Wish to invite to great banquet, to good work for all Asteroids-'' <br><br> ''Get lost'' <br><br> The Priestess appears beside Nii. ''Very foolish stubborn man,'' Nii remarks to the Priestess, and they both grin and disappear.",

"He curls up again, wondering what she has planned for him next. <br><br> This time it's the Priestess herself. She's wrapped a dark robe around her, some thin material. She sits down beside him in a rustle of darkness. ''I'll make a deal,'' she says. <br><br> He groans Even now he keeps thinking what she looks beneath that robe. <br><br> ''Do the favor that you've been asked. Go to the Ceremony and serve the banquet for the old man. In return, the ship will give you favor.'' <br.<br> ''What does that do for me?''",

"''She'll give you whatever you want. Recycling algae. Supplies. She's got a ship you can have, larger than the one you came with. <br><br> He squints. <br><br> ''That's all there is to it?

All the old  stories talk of ships where you  could walk  from one end  to  the other without spacehabbing. <br> <br> Not the Nii.<br> <br> She is space.",

 "In half-seen glints and darknesses  out the window, Tam glimpses the old Greatship: a complex orbital mathematics of cargo  pods, life  areas, and once-independent ships. The pieces of  the Nii move around  each other in slow circles, a decaying orrery of fragments.  Somewhere a central computer is keeping track of  this mathematical cloud. <br> <br> And, armed with its downloaded information about those orbits, the horizator jets its own complex orbit through the ship",

 " Suddenly, the horizator drops in a gravity tumble ",//221 animated falling 

 "The horizator smashes Tam against the floor, and everything goes black.",

" Blackness and dizziness. His head aches. Blood is gumming his eyes. <br> <br> Whispers. Brady’s voice. <br> <br> ‘‘ Let the girl have him, Nii … Then kill  him. The girl’s mine.’’ <br> <br> Kill him. Tam groans, brushes at his eyes as if he hasn’t been awake enough to hear.",

"He is staring up  at a ceiling of gilded mirrors. His head is propped up on a cotton-covered pillow embroidered with gold. Above him is an astonishing mura.  Of a Priestess and a Red King, lying in space, hands just touching. The Solar System wheels behind  them. Following its movement tugs at his eyes painfully and makes him nauseated. Half-unconscious, he lets his eyes fall closed. <br> <br> He feels long nails scratching across the back of his neck, then hears Brady’s voice. ‘‘ Didn’t have to hit him so hard, Nii. Ne’mind. Don’t need him long. Send the girl in.’’ <br> <br> Half-unconscious, he feels the faint breeze from an opening door. ",

 "‘‘Leave you two alone,’’ Brady mutters. Tam hears the click of his long toenails on the floor. Somewhere in this room with no iris-doors, is an iris-door squeaks closed. <br> <br> Then a scent sweeps over him. He knows instantly what kind of woman this is. <br> <br> The sent is something rich, indescribable, like the air of spring. Scents of grass and  vegetables mingling with the smell of womansex. He know it;s a trick, but it makes him want to  roll with her in that grass, he can smell the crushed scent of it underneath there bodies. <br> <br> He wants to cry with weakness and desire, crawl at her feet in unquestioning devotion. <br> <br> He want to stagger to his feet and run. Before  the Priestess get him. ",

"He opens blood-gummed eyes. <br> <br> At most she’s eighteen, maybe younger that that, a girl, all big eyes and long legs. Thin, knobby-kneed. She is naked and he can see her ribs under her small breasts. Her body is dark and freckled all over with little stars, and they glow, so that looking at her is like losing yourself in the stars: you can look forever into the dark spaces between the brightness. <br> <br> Over her body are scattered seeds. They look like glitter, little silver spangles. Genetic material is the most valuable commodity in the System. Her body-decoration-if any pirate could git it off-could ransome a planet. ",

 "She’s running her hand across his shoulders. The bruises stop aching as she touches them. <br> <br> She still has the sickle earring in her ear. <br> <br> A Virgin Priestess.",

"Sleeping with her would be stronger and sweeter than with any other woman in the  System. But wouldn't survive it.<br> <br> Not the way he is now. <br> <br> A virgin Priestess  doesn’t have a Red King. When  she sleeps with her first man, she makes him into her  lover, bound to her forever. <br> <br> Servant of the Priestess. <br> <br> And of the Empire. ",

"Like the jerk of a reflex, loyalty to her spasms him. He wants to worship her to protect her. The feeling is as strong as the smell  inside his head. <br> <br> He digs his nails in to his wounded palm to distract himself with pain.<br>He’s supposed to be resistant to the rho-pheromone. <br> <br> Not quite resistant enough. <br> <br> As she touches his forehead his headache flares, then flickers  out. She takes  his hand, though he tries to jerk it away, and brushes her fingers over the palm. <br> <br> The pain spears his hand like a spike, then suddenly both hurts are gone. ",

"Where the wound was, the skin is red and tight, a new scar. He flexes it, feeling the strength coming back into the burned nerves. <br> <br> He staggers shakily to his feet and leans against the wall of the mirrored room. <br> <br> ‘‘Keep your hands off me.’’ ",

"If you don’t breathe the same air  with a priestess, you can resist her. <br> <br> He’s still wearing his skintite. He fumbles for the hood and clicks the faceplate shut. <br> <br> How much air has he got left? ",

"In Tam’s faceplate a yellow puff-of-air icon blinks  briefly, then fades. He used up a lot of air getting to the Lady Nii.<br> <br> Among the gold-threaded pillows on the floor  there  is  a litter of bright scraps of cloth. He picks up the largest he sees, a red silk cloak. ‘‘Put some clothes on.’’ His voice echoes  back through  the throat-mike to his  ears. He switches on the external comm  and tries again.  ",//(blocks around the edges)  i think the blocks represent  how much air he has left  in  the suit … it shows only when he is wearing the skintite.

"Slowly the Priestess shakes  her head. She holds the silk crumpled in her  hand.  <br> <br>  She looks as if she’s been hit too. She’s barely able to focus on him. <br> <br> ‘‘Ship,’’ she says in a low voice. ‘‘Nii. Damaged-hit. I  want to help her. Please.’’ <br> <br> She drops the cloak and holds out her hands to him. <br> <br> He steps back and kicks  the clothing back to her.  ",

" ‘‘ i’m not going to give you any help. I won’t be your dog. I won’t sleep with you. Even if Brady weren’t going to kill me agterward.’’ Tam says. <br> <br> She looks up at him, startled. <br> <br> ‘‘You and your kind come to an ITC for a Ceremony, and when you’re gone the ITC  owes the Empire three years’ wages for genetic updates, and  every man and woman old enough to screw is babbling about how  wonderful  the Emperor is. I was in the cold mines on Circe for Four years. As long as my air holds out, i’m holding out on you. And then, Virgin, I die.’’ ",

"She sits down on the floor, her arms between her legs, ignoring the cloak. <br> <br> ‘‘The Nii took a hit,’’ she says, slowly, slurring her words. ‘‘A meteor.  Smashed something in her memory. She hasn't worked right  since. She-forgets how people work. Gives me Ceremony wine all the  time. She will give you food,’’ the Priestess says, almost defensively, ‘‘if you ask.’’ ",

" ‘‘You ought to as for food more often,’’ he says. <br> <br> She smiles an odd proud smile, looking up at him. ‘‘I dont care,’’ she confides. ‘‘When Brady woke me up  he tried to do  the Ceremony with me. He started- before I was even awake. It was an illusion-ceremony, the banquet, the attendants, the ship tour. He made believe that he was doing the  Solar System dance for me. Then he tried to  be my Red King-’’ She shudders and wraps her arms around her body, twisting back and forth as if there is something in her body that she  wants to get away from. ‘‘He tries every shipnight,’’ she says. Her back is marked with long shallow scabs. She could  heal them if she cared about them.  ", 

"There’s a door set into the mirrored wall. Tam goes through, away from his hurting  enemy, into  the next room. <br> <br> The room adjoining the mirrored chamber is swathed in rotted  silk. A pillow-bed in the center of the room is mashed down and disarranged. It looks like sex  that has gon on too long, too dispiritedly. The room smells of Brady’s stink. <br> <br> Tam looks up at the ceiling, finds concealed wing nuts. He pushes the trap door upward. ‘‘ Airtube,’’ he explains. He tosses her the cloak again and this time she puts it on. ", 

"The air tubing smells like old plastic. It is only about four feet in diameter: stiff, black, and accordion-pleated stuff that flexes as they hoist themselves through the trapdoor and crouch in it. <br> <br> ‘‘The Nii can’t reach  us here,’’ Tam explains, ‘‘any more than you can reach inside your veins.  She can’t hear us or see us.  We’ve disappeared.’’ ",

 "‘‘She’ll come  after us,’’ the Priestess says. <br> <br> ‘‘Sure. But she  dosen’t  know where to find  us.’’  Tam squint  down the long  black  tube. ‘‘Airtube’s the safest place to hide out. No spybots. Union law.’’ <br> <br> ‘‘Union– ?’’ The Priestess looks curiously at his new scar though the transparent glove of his skintite. He polarizes the gloves  dark so she can’t see her work. <br> <br> ‘‘Yeah. I was a good Union airtube  repairman. Then I was  a terrorist. Then I was in  the cold mines on Circe. Thant’s me.’’ ",//(blocks around the edges)

"‘‘I  could  change Nii’s programming,’’ the Priestess says. <br> <br> he looks at  her. ‘‘How?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘If I can get into core memory. I could change your status  too. Give you Ship’s Favor so she  won’t kill you.’’  <br> <br> ‘‘What do you need?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘My powers.’’  She touches  the silver sickle moon in her ear. ",

" ‘‘Your choice,’’ she says. Sure, he thinks. My choice.",//241 

// 241 - 3 choices - 1. “I could give the  Priestess her  powers.  The  way I figure it, out  best chance  is to  reprogram the  Nii.”,

"Sure, their best chance is to reprogram the Nii. But it means total surrender to an Emperor's Daughter. <br><br> Not Tam Rosse. <br><br> Not yet. ",// bake to 3 choises

"Can he find weapons to use against the Nii? <br> <br> The Nii was a greatship. Some of the ships that were traveling with her should still be here. <br> <br> They may be armed. <br> <br> Where are they? ", 

"‘‘I have a map,’’ Tam  says. <br> <br> ‘‘The one the Nii broadcasts?’’ the Priestess asks. <br> <br> The Priestess moves  to sit by him. He shakes his head and passes the map over to her. <br> <br> He looks at her face while  she reads it. She frowns. <br> <br> ‘‘ Too easy?’’  he asks her. <br> <br> She nods. ‘‘It’s part of the Nii’s defense system. It wouldn’t be too intelligent to broadcast an accurate map.’’ ",

"She stands up and wraps the cloak around her.<br> <br> ‘‘I don’t need my powers for everything. If we can get to Central Storage,  there’s an H-class troop transport in one of the pods.  I don’t think it’s damaged. It’s got lasar guns and shields.’’ <br> <br>  ‘‘Any ideas on how we get there?’’ <br><br> ‘‘ I think I can take  control of the Horizator,’’  the Priestess  says <br><br> ‘‘And drive  it manually?’’ Through all the space junk of the Nii? ",

"The Priestess looks up straight at him. She’s still smiling. Right through him her look goes,  desperate  and angry and almost insane. He can’t imagin what being with Brady was like for her. If it  was anything like Circe- <br><br> ‘‘Lead on, virgin,’’ he says. ",

// animated quarocs spyflies 

"A swarm of quarocs follow  them through the maze of airtubes. ",//247

"Through the airtube exit rille they can see the horizator. The door stands open. <br><br> Tam and the Priestess drop out of the airlock grille and throw themselves inside. The door hisses shut. <br><br> The Priestess lays her hand on the control  panel. ",

"She edges the horizator away from the rocky core of the Nii. Tam holds his breath. Pieces of space junk drift past hem in a slow-motion arcade game, coming too  close. The horizatior lights are dim, and Tam can see dark things tumbling against the stars.  <br><br> Up ahead he sees a fragmentary skeleton of girders. <br><br> ‘‘Central Storage,’’ the Priestess identifies it. ‘‘ Dock Four should be close by.’’",

"‘‘Can you program the Nii to kill Brady? He asks. <br><br> ‘‘No. He’s her captain.’’ The priestess relaxes from her concentration. ‘‘In  the ‘69 Rebellion,  one of Nicholsun’s Priestesses killed a captain aboard her ship and reprogrammed the hip to attack Circe prison. Now– I have programming against doing things like that. I can’t take  over a ship or kill her captain  or make the ship kill herself. I can olu serve the ship. Heal her.’’ <br><br> ‘‘What were the Priestesses doing fighting against the Empire?’’ The Priestess smiles faintly. ‘‘We were on the blasphemers’ side. Don’t believe everything you read in the Encyclopedia. The winners wrote it.’’ ",

"They jet forward suddenly to avoid a drifting cargo pod and something  hits the hull, a glancing blow. Tam sees something carom off at an angle, wobbling end over end. The Priestess’s face is lick with sweat. <br><br> Unexpectedly a studded door drifts into their viewport. On the door is the Imperial seal, a sheaf of rice. The horizator’s docking-frapples clang. Metal shrieks as the  little ship slides along the big one. THen, as the dock absorbs their inertia, they come to rest  beside the big ship’s lock. <br><br> The yellow puff-of air icon has reappeared on Tam’s faceplate screen. Now it’s blinking, calling attention to itself. <br><br> The two airlocks snug against each other, and the Priestess opens both doors. With a pop, the horizator’s air dis[erses inside the troop carrier.",

"No lights in the ship, no warmth. The bone-chilling cold of true space. The Priestess’s stars blink out and her skin goes completely dark. Human life cannot survive here; She is breathing from internal storage. <br><br> ‘‘Turn on some lights,’’ he tells her. ",

"All over her body she begins glowing softly. The greenish light reflects off steel, a thick -walled double airlock-two locks, Tam thinks, for decon against the plague. He turns to look at the Priestess and can’t look away. Her  nipples and her lips, the ends of  her nose and her  fingers are  a  darker blue-green; so are her  fingernails and toenails, the  soles  of  ether  feet.  Her hair is  dark; the rest  of  her, greenish  yellow, ghostly, grotesque. <br><br> But for a moment he can imagine making love with a woman who glows. The fantasy is so real he  can feel  her not-quite-human  shin. As he entered her, a visible red glow would spread over his body, everywhere she had toughed it, hot and flickering with firelight. <br><br> He blinks and the fantasy is gone. ‘‘Turn that off. Find some lights,’’ he says harshly.",

"The old lights come on, wavering.<br>,<br> Inside,a narrow corridor. To their left,a crowded control room with space for two pilots. Ahead, a kitchen. <br><br> ‘‘No food,’’ the Priestess says, looking into compartments. <br><br> To  their  right, a padded transport area crowded with pods, now stowed away, but open and rumpled, as though whatever happened in this AV struck in a shipnight. Beyond the transport area is a door leading to the weapons area. A book is abandoned beside the pod. Tam  picks it up idly and touches the screen, which flickers to show a man licking a woman's breasts while she arches back in ecstasy. Tam drops it quickly and looks up to see the Priestess watching him.",

"‘‘It’s cold here,’’ she says. It is space-cold though the heat circuits of his suit are at maximum. The pods look warm, still warmer if two people were in one… She looks like a naked woman covered with  a  thin red silk  cloak, fragile  and crumbling. He can see the faint chitin-like smoothness  of her skin, the sign of the spacehabbed. Her breath does not smock in the cold; the  moisture is being captured and recirculated. <br><br> Emperor’s Daughter. In memory he can still see the  green glow and his answering red one.<br><br> ‘‘Put some more clothes on,’’ he says  roughly. He tosses a thick jacket from one f=of the storage bays across to her, as if that would change things. ‘‘ I'm going to check the controls. We need air and heat.’’ ",

"Tam Rosse takes the lead pilot's seat and look for the controls.<br><br> Almost as soon as they turn on, the oxygen depletion alarm starts wailing. Like the recycling algae on Tam’s ship, the algae here are dead. <br><br> The yellow puff-of-air icon on Tam’s faceplate screen is blinking faster. As he watches it, it brightens and glows steadily, and a smaller wailing tone starrs up in the suit’s internal comm. ",

"The Priestess slips into the pilot’s seat next to him. <br><br> You can get along without air for a while. I can’t <br><br> Watch me die, lady, rather than sleep with you. <br><br> ‘‘I’ve got to find air,’’ Tam says",

Without intervention, small populations rapidly lose genetic identity with their ancestors. To maintan a common gene pool, breeding programs and mutation control are vital, especially in areas of high background radiation. Crossbreeding is also a necessity. <br><br> During the early stages of the settlement of the Asteroids, it was realized that genetic updating would become a necessary part of the health of each Asteroid ITC.",

"About sixty-five years ago a man named Harry Nicholsun bid for and received the contract to update the ITCs' genetic pool. It was a hazardous job, because it often meant being exposed to, and exposing others to, new diseases, as well as introducing new genes into the pool. <br><br> On the surface, Nicholsun's contribution to Asteroid culture seemed innocuous if a little crude. Nicholsun was fortunate to start his business at the time when live pornographic theater was being replaced by 3D sense-linked vids (''illusions''). He could call on a wide range of live-theater actors, most of whom would go anywhere and do anything. <br><br> Nicholsun linked genetic distribution to sex.",

"Nicholsun Raves began with prayer and ceremonies, feasting, intoxication, and fireworks; they ended in mass copulation and the spread of the new germ plasm throughout the ship. Their ceremonial center was the Priestess, a nubile, sensual woman who performed naked except for her sacred glowing tattoos. Her consort was the Red Man or Red King. Invariably a condemned criminial, the Red King was chosen for his strength, skill with weapons, and virility, and was bound to the Priesyess for life by ''secret ceremonies.'' <br><br> Drawn from the uneducated parts of society and cut off from Terran culture by the sterility of the Asteroids, Asteroid dwellers eagerly sought the color and excitement that ''Great-day'' provided. A few comparatively sophisticated minds thought they saw through to Nicholsun's secret. For them, the Priestess and her Consort were simply an assistant genetic engineer and her bodyguard. Of course--until far to late--they did not see what Nicholsun was doing at all.",

"More surprisingly, of the Terran officials who dealt with Nicholsun, only one suspected his treachery. Lieut. Gregor Marczak, a minor official in the Genetics Bureau on Pallas, realized the truth when he observed his own extreme emotional reaction to a Priestess's visit in San-gatsu 867. <br><br> Nicholsun had not merely distributed genetic material; he had changed it. he had contaminated almost the entire genetic pool of the Asteroids with a sensitivity to a rho-pheromone he himself had engineered. <br><br> Nicholsun pioneered the concept of pheromonic linkage.",

"His terrible plot depended on two linked stages of infection. The first generation of victims were infected by a rhinovirus, which modified cells in the nasopharyngeal passages. The modified cells responded strongly to a kinship pheromone, developed by Nicholsun and given off by his genetically modified Priestesses and Red Kings. Stem cells were not affected and, as the modified cells died, the effect eventually wore off. bu the virus remained among the Asteroids, modifying itself like a cold virus, so that the population was subject to frequent reinfection. <br><br> The second infection was more insidious and more lasting. It entered the body through sexual contact and lived silently in the blood. On the first generation it had no apparent effect. But insidiously, in sperm and egg, it altered the very genetics of the population. On the children of the first generation, it produced the same effect as the rhinovirus did on the first. <br><br> Permanetly.",

"The effect of the victims was blind, loving loyalty to Nicholsun and all of his subordinates--who were genetically modified to emit rho-phermonone, but who could not pass the modification. <br><br> In other words, Nicholsun had created a new species, a race of workers genetically engineered for loyalty. red Kings were phermonically linked to their Priestesses. Priestesses and Kings, in turn, were pheromonically linked to Nicholsun himself. <br><br> Smell is an unanswerable arguement. The rhinocephalon, the part of the brain governing smell, is one of the oldest parts of the brain, unchanged since the reptiles. No one could resist a Priestess or a Red King. Intellectual convictions, no matter how sincerely held, simply made no difference. During the Riots of 869, infected Terran officials laid down their lives to protect ant-Terran Priestesses and Red Kings. Ironically, one of those was Marczak himself, shot for treason.",

"Nicholsun was executed at Castra Martis in 873. But by the time his ultimste treachery was punished, the modifications had spread too far. Most of the adults then living on the Asteroid Stations were carriers. All of their children- and Nicholsun's orgies had produced many children-carried the genetic plague. <br><br> Now, incapable of democracy, incapable of rational thought when their rulers are present, the populations of the Asteroids live in limbo. The plague has expressed itself in three generations of these unfortunate beings. The Asteroid population has been allowed to drop preciptously. <br><br> the large Hermes-Eccentric cargo ships, once the lifeblood of the Asteroids, have almost all been moved Sunward orbits, since Asteroids trade involves the risk of genetic contamination.",

"Unless the plague is cured, all of the population of the Asteroids will be allowed to die. <br><br> The most stringent precautions are taken to avoid contact between the true Terran stock and the Asteroid dwellers, who can merely be called humanlike. These necessary precautions have led to several small revolts, with regrettable loss of life. Nicholsun, and Nicholsun alone, is to blame for these deaths. <br><br> Ironically, Nicholsun's false ''religion'' is now the only hope for the Asteroid dwellers. Terran technology has made the role of Priestesses and Red Kings a benevolent one. The Priestess, moving from asteroid to dying asteroid, is now a Terran genetic technician, carrying with her the latest experimental weapons against Nicholsun's plague. Today she is phermonically linked, not to a mad dictator, but to the Terran bureaucracy and to the welfare of the ship or outpost she serves.",

"She and her Red King, still her protector in these wild outposts, link the Asteroid dwellers genetically with their Terran cousins. They distribute all Terran gene modifications to even the smallest operating Asteroid. They add all improvements to algae, flora, fauna--all the benefits of continuiing Terran arcoculture--to the arcology of each Asteroid. <br><br> Up to the present, no one has found a way of reversing the effects of Nicholsun's plague. But the search continues. SOmeday the Asteroid dwellers will be freed of this curse. Someday they will be full members of the human race again.",

"Tam looks up at her in shock. <br><br> ''Nicholsun and the Priestess fought against the Emperor?'' For a moment he's not able to talk. <br><br> Suddenly a huge concussion reverberates through the horizator. ",

"''Eternal Mother! What's that?'' <br><br> Outside, in the dark, <br><br> starlight glitters off huge half-seen claws.",

"Grapples thump on to the horizator from all sides. The Priestess jabs at the horizator jets. <br><br> ''Don't waste your time!'' Tam yells at her. ''That's a cargo robot! It can handle a ship fifty times our size.'' A huge steel claw comes at them out of the darkness. It touches the side of the horizator's hull, and the ship vibrates around them. <br><br> ''I'll do the fighting--you get through to the Nii!''",

"He jumps for the lasergun and its shield. <br><br> rearing above them, the claw looms, its blind shark end flexing like a wasp's sting. then it rips down. Soundlessly it tears the horizator in half. <br><br> One half spirals away, smooth and fast, blinking off into an infinity of darkness. <br><br> the other half, with both of them clinging to it, is still clutched in the monster claws.",

"Whatever the Priestess has made Tam, it is quick and deadly. He's an animal, uncontrollable, stuffed with reflexes to the end of his fingers. <br><br> Frantically they struggle with unfamiliar controls. The repair system spews out replacement parts faster than he can catch them. Fragments of memory flash across the monitor screens.",

"The entry port irises open. Force fields play around it, lambient white. Laser fire shoots out toward them. <br><br> Behind them stands Brady, invulnverable. And beside him seems to stand an old japanese woman, wild grey hair streaming down to her waist, shrieking in mad glee.",

"It is as if something had suddenly fallen silent. But it is only that the white fire around Brady flickers and dies. The robots freeze where they are.<br><br> And the mad woman who stands next to Brady shimmers like a badly made illusion and disappears. <br><br> In her place is something not quite a woman, an ideal and newly made thinkg, smooth, bland, questioning, strange. She is Japanese too, dressed in a style old a thousand years ago: red kimono, markless  oval face, smooth black hair. <br><br> ''I am Nii,'' a voice whispers into Tam's comm. ",//

"She is a hundred meters away from him, but it seems as though she is very close. He can feel her hand touch him. <br><br> ''Favor, Lady?'' he asks.<br><br> ''You have my Favor, Red King. ",

"Brady is as far as the Ship, but it seems as though he, too, is in front of them, standing  in  the ruins of their horizator. Caught by the illusion for a moment, Tam raises his laser gun. <br><br>  The Priestess holds back his hand.<br><br> ''Nii?'' Brady  looks  around as if he has been blinded. ''Where you, old girl?''<br><br> ''I cannot  fix such things,'' the Priestess says to Nii. ''He is old and worn out. Humans don't repair as well as ships.''<br><br> They both hear the Nii's reply. <<Leave him to me.>> ",

"For a moment, it is as if they see Brady's eyes -- see the final illusion he is  given. A womanwalks toward Brady out of the ruins of the horizator. She is bent, but also young. Though the long sheets of her grey hair her body shines whith stars.  <br><br> She holds out her hand and he takes it. <br><br> Befor them steatches a grand mirrored corridor, lined  with sconces of candles. Men and woman in Ceremony dress hold up jeweled cups  of  wine  and toast the lovers.  Silk cloaks and tabards glow with red for celebration, with a silvery white-blue for the Terran sky. And all the colors of the Fertile Worlds shimmer and reflect like a rainbow, dow the corridor as far as the eye can see. ",

" ''Gotcha girl! My beloved!  Here at last!'' <br><br> Two small cargo robots lock their arms around his wrists. <br><br> ''I waited! I came throught!'' <br><br> The cargo robots  puff their jets, and  Brady  falls away dow the  mirrored corridor, down in  to the infintie dark, laughing in the  arms of his lover. ",

"That  night they sleep  in the ship's Water Center. They pile sleeping  pods on themselves, hug eachother convulsively,but they are still cold, as if they too have  gone into Brady's darkness. <br><br> ''Sleep'' the priestess says, but  Tam does not sleep. bodyguards do not; he knows that without having been told it. He lies  awake,  holding her,  alertness in his bones. For the rest  of his life it will be like this. <br><br> He is too numb yet to mourn his lost humanity, or to begin to explore what he can do now. ",

"Brady loved a ship and the ship killed him, because it had to live. Tam is in love with a  Priestess,  who is more powerful than a ship. <br><br> He murmurs '' The Uprising'' as a man in the arms of his wife murmurs the name of his lost love. ",

"In the  middle of the shipnight they remeber her  silver earring.  the Priestess finds it abandoned on the floor of the horizator. they bury it together, the feel of it like they are burying a body. When they are done they sit together. <br><br> ''it dosen't make sense,'' says Tam after a while. <br><br> ''What?'' <br><br> ''It doesn't make sense. That Encyclopedia articlesaid that nobody could resist a Priestess. But that's not true. Anybody can, as long as they don't breath the same air as the Priestess. And some can anyway. That's why you need guards.'' ",

"''What are we doing then?'' the Priestess asks finally.",

" ''Want to  find out?'' says Tam Rosse. ",//324


 
// 3. “Once Brady is dead, the Nii  may be more reasonable.  Kill Brady…”,

" ‘‘Suppose I killed Brady.’’ <br> <br> The Priestess smiles. ‘‘Did you see the little black stubs on the ceiling in the  corridors?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘Under the spy eyes? Sure.’’ <br> <br> ‘‘Pulse lasers. And Brady has Ship’s Favor. The Lady Nii protects him. She’ll kill you’’ The Priestess smiles faintly. ‘‘I could reprogram her.

// "He's heard in prison that the earring is the key. <br><br> There is no mystery about the Priestesses. They're arco-engineers. They're zapped full of nanocomputers that do all the work while they play Sex Goddess of the Universe. Removing the earring kickes in their programming. The rest is smoke and mirrors. <br.<br> And bodies. <br><br> ''Fuck the Emperor,'' he mutters.",

//"He touches his red prison suit and it opens down to his groin. The ''ice'' is not ice, but it is cold, jellylike on his bare skin. Her body slips greasily under his, He holds her down on the slab, rough, his left arm with its half-useless hand pinning her across her shoulder blades, He needs more hands than he has. For four year he has though of the first woman he would have after prison. A Pallas womam, perfumed in a thousand places. This girl is cold and unlubricated, like an iced rubber glove. <br><br> With the icy cold white light and the ice jelly, it's like making love to the dead in a morgue.",

//"He rides his brutality, he pushes against it like G-force. He feels power like the prison trusties on Circe must have felt toward him. <br><br> He sees a silver of her eyeballs under her partly closed eyelids. She is waking up. Suddenly he is uncontrollable, shuddering, coming in a spasm of revenge. <br><br> He rips her virgin's earing and throws it onto the floor. A globe of blood swells in the ice near her ear, then spreads.",

//"No more virgin Priestess. And she hasn't turned him into her slave. <br><br> The ship's heat cricuits out in as he fastens his jumpsuit. He begins to sweat, smelling his bodystink over the cool neutral air of the lifeship. The half-moon of the ice dissolves, rivulets flowing down into the surface if the egg-ship. Her blood flows with it, down in a watery delta. The lifeship will use it. <br><br> The girl opens her eyes and reaches up her hand to her bloodied ear.",

//"She looks up at him, her eyes ageless and unfathomable. ''You did the Ceremony,'' she says. He nods. He has power over her. he feels it in what his body has done to hers. <br>,br> ''Now I have my powers,'' she murmurs. <br><br> Not over me, Tam thinks. ''I did you a favor. I woke you up. Now I need your help to get the ship going,'' he says. <br><br> She looks him deep in the eyes. The blood is still flowing from her ear. She pinches the lobe between two fingers and the blood stops. <br><br> ''Oh, yes,'' she says, ''I can heal the Lady Nii.'' He puts his hand on her arm but she draws back, following him without touching him.",

//"He goes first, propelling himself down the pitted and murky port corridor toward the greatship. He can see the white plume of air leaking from his suit. He slaps a seal-patch pver it. <br><br> The priestess needs no suit here. She is spacehabbed. <br><br. He has only a dagger, a prison weapon, made from the Circean mineral called heartsblood, chipped and edged in the long nights in the mines. The thongs that wrap the handle are a man's skin. <br><br> Around the lock there are only the fossilized pale marks of water impurities; it has been so long since the lock was opened that no ice crystals blur its metal leaves.",
