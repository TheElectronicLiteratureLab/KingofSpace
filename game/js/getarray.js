"It is a  place of unimaginable  emptiness. In 690 billion square miles, only three asteroids can support a Class A town: Pallas the Whorehouse,  Circe the prison, and Ceres the Bureaucracy. From these three asteroids, hidden  behind  glass screens  and virus filters, the Terran administrators try to hold a territory  larger than all of the Empire.   <br> The Independent Trading Colonies scratch out a living in Beltspace. Each ITC supports perhaps 50 to 100 humans. But between the ITCs and the three, there is emptiness, desertion, and silence. <br> 50 years ago, it was different.

"Year 919 of  the Empire. On his dying spaceboat,  Tam Ross dreams… <br> He is back on ITC 3502, curled up  in the sleeping pod he shares with his mother. His mother is a very important person,  a watchman at the WaterCenter. Their pod hangs by the big water tanks. <br> He is an important person too. <br>  He cracks  open the sleeping pod and sniffs the cool fresh air. The auxiliary lights flicker dimly. The sunlights are still off. In a tiny spotlight, the sacred puppet of  the Rice Emperor dances in the wind from the air vents.", //2 (corner image)

"Tam touches the edge of the sleeping pod and wriggles out the seam. The cool damp air raises goosebumps on his skin. He runs over the prickly- grassed nutrient floor and climbs up the ladder to the biggest tank. <br> He jumps in and begins swimming among the koi,  in the cold early-morning water, and the big fish rub their bodies against his and kiss him, asking for food.", // 3 (sleeping pod image ?) 

"But in the dream, the Rice Emperor reaches up to his puppet frame and breaks the strings that hold him. He strides across the air toward Tam, across the surface of the water. He stands on the water, glaring with rage, pointing at Tam, and the Imperial Soldiers surround them. <br> 'Blasphemer! Traitor!' <br> He grabs Tam tight by the left hand and draws his fingernail across the complex gene-tattoo that covers Tam's palm. The tattoo that shows his plague resistance. The pain claws at Tam's chest and he cannot breath. the gene-tattoo bubbles and burst.", //4(corner image)

"His eyes blur as he tries to read nav charts. He is only twenty-tree but his hands shake as he keys in chart coordinates. <br> He remembers his dream and smiles mirthlessly. They burned his hand on Pallas, trying to make him give names of the others who were trying to breed Plague resistance. Some Priestess's slave-King burned the gene tattoo off his palm, skin, nerves  and all. He clenches and unclenches it, holding his anger in his bad hand. <br> There is no inhabited asteroid within a halfmonth, not even a miner's claim. And he has less that a shipday worth of air.", //7

An old one, and huge. <br> It's the size of a Class A town, a great irregular cloud of modules and environments, furred with the junk of a thousand System journeys, revolving around itself in a vast complexity of orbits. At its edges he can see the stars though the cloud, but in its center the pods swarm so thickly that the ship looks like a single vast solid object. <br> And it is dark.

" Inside the airlock waits  a man. <br> <br> Lice  crawl in his matted  gray hair; his body smells; he is spider-thin, a man who has spent his life in low gravity.  His yellow skin is smeared  with dirt. Old power wires  are tangled into  his hair,  wires plaited into a  rough circle like a crown.  He stares  like a man who  has  seen too much infinity alone. <br> <br> ‘I’m king,’  he says. <br> <br> His jumpsuit,  stiff with dirt, hangs on his body. He scratches at his withered crotch. He plucks at  the Imperial name-patch and looks at it curiously as  though it is instructions for a machine he dose  not  use. ‘King Brady,’ he  mutters. <br> <br> Tam Rosse collapses,  shaking with the  cold. The  ship heat circuits cut in with a rattle and the sunlights din the airlock.", 

" ''Favor,’ Tam Rosse stammers. <br> <br> The old man hunkers down and grabs Tam Rosse’s wounded hand painfully. Tam gags as he smells Brady: a long-unwashed smell of urine, bad breath and body girt. The old man peers at the crossed-out gene-tattoo. <br> <br> ‘They cut you, boy? Or burn you? No? Then I got a use for you.’ ",

"Brady pushes Tam  toward the door of a beat-up little cargo pod: the horizator. <br> <br> The old man taps a corroded node-speaker by the horizator buttons. <br> <br> ‘‘ Nii, you listening? Nii, this one’s - what’s your name, boy? Rosse. Tam Rosse. Favored to me. Goes where I say and nowhere else.’’ <br> <br> The horizator does nothing. ",

 "The horizator walls go glassy. Brady turns away to see  the  entry port dropping away.  <br> <br> Tam looks out  the transparent walls, astounded.<br> <br> A long time ago humans  thought  ships  were a single cylinder or a  wheel,  something  connected. All the old  stories talk of ships where you  could walk  from one end  to  the other without spacehabbing. <br> <br> Not the Nii.<br> <br> She is space.",

 "In half-seen glints and darknesses  out the window, Tam glimpses the old Greatship: a complex orbital mathematics of cargo  pods, life  areas, and once-independent ships. The pieces of  the Nii move around  each other in slow circles, a decaying orrery of fragments.  Somewhere a central computer is keeping track of  this mathematical cloud. <br> <br> And, armed with its downloaded information about those orbits, the horizator jets its own complex orbit through the ship",

"He is staring up  at a ceiling of gilded mirrors. His head is propped up on a cotton-covered pillow embroidered with gold. Above him is an astonishing mura.  Of a Priestess and a Red King, lying in space, hands just touching. The Solar System wheels behind  them. Following its movement tugs at his eyes painfully and makes him nauseated. Half-unconscious, he lets his eyes fall closed. <br> <br> He feels long nails scratching across the back of his neck, then hears Brady’s voice. ‘‘ Didn’t have to hit him so hard, Nii. Ne’mind. Don’t need him long. Send the girl in.’’ <br> <br> Half-unconscious, he feels the faint breeze from an opening door. ",

 "‘‘Leave you two alone,’’ Brady mutters. Tam hears the click of his long toenails on the floor. Somewhere in this room with no iris-doors, is an iris-door squeaks closed. <br> <br> Then a scent sweeps over him. He knows instantly what kind of woman this is. <br> <br> The sent is something rich, indescribable, like the air of spring. Scents of grass and  vegetables mingling with the smell of womansex. He know it;s a trick, but it makes him want to  roll with her in that grass, he can smell the crushed scent of it underneath there bodies. <br> <br> He wants to cry with weakness and desire, crawl at her feet in unquestioning devotion. <br> <br> He want to stagger to his feet and run. Before  the Priestess get him. ",

"He opens blood-gummed eyes. <br> <br> At most she’s eighteen, maybe younger that that, a girl, all big eyes and long legs. Thin, knobby-kneed. She is naked and he can see her ribs under her small breasts. Her body is dark and freckled all over with little stars, and they glow, so that looking at her is like losing yourself in the stars: you can look forever into the dark spaces between the brightness. <br> <br> Over her body are scattered seeds. They look like glitter, little silver spangles. Genetic material is the most valuable commodity in the System. Her body-decoration-if any pirate could git it off-could ransome a planet. ",

 "She’s running her hand across his shoulders. The bruises stop aching as she touches them. <br> <br> She still has the sickle earring in her ear. <br> <br> A Virgin Priestess.",

"Sleeping with her would be stronger and sweeter than with any other woman in the  System. But wouldn't survive it.<br> <br> Not the way he is now. <br> <br> A virgin Priestess  doesn’t have a Red King. When  she sleeps with her first man, she makes him into her  lover, bound to her forever. <br> <br> Servant of the Priestess. <br> <br> And of the Empire. ",

"Like the jerk of a reflex, loyalty to her spasms him. He wants to worship her to protect her. The feeling is as strong as the smell  inside his head. <br> <br> He digs his nails in to his wounded palm to distract himself with pain.<br>He’s supposed to be resistant to the rho-pheromone. <br> <br> Not quite resistant enough. <br> <br> As she touches his forehead his headache flares, then flickers  out. She takes  his hand, though he tries to jerk it away, and brushes her fingers over the palm. <br> <br> The pain spears his hand like a spike, then suddenly both hurts are gone. ",

"Where the wound was, the skin is red and tight, a new scar. He flexes it, feeling the strength coming back into the burned nerves. <br> <br> He staggers shakily to his feet and leans against the wall of the mirrored room. <br> <br> ‘‘Keep your hands off me.’’ ",

"If you don’t breathe the same air  with a priestess, you can resist her. <br> <br> He’s still wearing his skintite. He fumbles for the hood and clicks the faceplate shut. <br> <br> How much air has he got left? ",

"In Tam’s faceplate a yellow puff-of-air icon blinks  briefly, then fades. He used up a lot of air getting to the Lady Nii.<br> <br> Among the gold-threaded pillows on the floor  there  is  a litter of bright scraps of cloth. He picks up the largest he sees, a red silk cloak. ‘‘Put some clothes on.’’ His voice echoes  back through  the throat-mike to his  ears. He switches on the external comm  and tries again.  ",//(blocks around the edges)  i think the blocks represent  how much air he has left  in  the suit … it shows only when he is wearing the skintite.

"Slowly the Priestess shakes  her head. She holds the silk crumpled in her  hand.  <br> <br>  She looks as if she’s been hit too. She’s barely able to focus on him. <br> <br> ‘‘Ship,’’ she says in a low voice. ‘‘Nii. Damaged-hit. I  want to help her. Please.’’ <br> <br> She drops the cloak and holds out her hands to him. <br> <br> He steps back and kicks  the clothing back to her.  ",

" ‘‘ i’m not going to give you any help. I won’t be your dog. I won’t sleep with you. Even if Brady weren’t going to kill me agterward.’’ Tam says. <br> <br> She looks up at him, startled. <br> <br> ‘‘You and your kind come to an ITC for a Ceremony, and when you’re gone the ITC  owes the Empire three years’ wages for genetic updates, and  every man and woman old enough to screw is babbling about how  wonderful  the Emperor is. I was in the cold mines on Circe for Four years. As long as my air holds out, i’m holding out on you. And then, Virgin, I die.’’ ",

"She sits down on the floor, her arms between her legs, ignoring the cloak. <br> <br> ‘‘The Nii took a hit,’’ she says, slowly, slurring her words. ‘‘A meteor.  Smashed something in her memory. She hasn't worked right  since. She-forgets how people work. Gives me Ceremony wine all the  time. She will give you food,’’ the Priestess says, almost defensively, ‘‘if you ask.’’ ",

" ‘‘You ought to as for food more often,’’ he says. <br> <br> She smiles an odd proud smile, looking up at him. ‘‘I dont care,’’ she confides. ‘‘When Brady woke me up  he tried to do  the Ceremony with me. He started- before I was even awake. It was an illusion-ceremony, the banquet, the attendants, the ship tour. He made believe that he was doing the  Solar System dance for me. Then he tried to  be my Red King-’’ She shudders and wraps her arms around her body, twisting back and forth as if there is something in her body that she  wants to get away from. ‘‘He tries every shipnight,’’ she says. Her back is marked with long shallow scabs. She could  heal them if she cared about them.  ", 

"There’s a door set into the mirrored wall. Tam goes through, away from his hurting  enemy, into  the next room. <br> <br> The room adjoining the mirrored chamber is swathed in rotted  silk. A pillow-bed in the center of the room is mashed down and disarranged. It looks like sex  that has gon on too long, too dispiritedly. The room smells of Brady’s stink. <br> <br> Tam looks up at the ceiling, finds concealed wing nuts. He pushes the trap door upward. ‘‘ Airtube,’’ he explains. He tosses her the cloak again and this time she puts it on. ", 

"The air tubing smells like old plastic. It is only about four feet in diameter: stiff, black, and accordion-pleated stuff that flexes as they hoist themselves through the trapdoor and crouch in it. <br> <br> ‘‘The Nii can’t reach  us here,’’ Tam explains, ‘‘any more than you can reach inside your veins.  She can’t hear us or see us.  We’ve disappeared.’’ ",

 "‘‘She’ll come  after us,’’ the Priestess says. <br> <br> ‘‘Sure. But she  dosen’t  know where to find  us.’’  Tam squint  down the long  black  tube. ‘‘Airtube’s the safest place to hide out. No spybots. Union law.’’ <br> <br> ‘‘Union– ?’’ The Priestess looks curiously at his new scar though the transparent glove of his skintite. He polarizes the gloves  dark so she can’t see her work. <br> <br> ‘‘Yeah. I was a good Union airtube  repairman. Then I was  a terrorist. Then I was in  the cold mines on Circe. Thant’s me.’’ ",//(blocks around the edges)

"‘‘I  could  change Nii’s programming,’’ the Priestess says. <br> <br> he looks at  her. ‘‘How?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘If I can get into core memory. I could change your status  too. Give you Ship’s Favor so she  won’t kill you.’’  <br> <br> ‘‘What do you need?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘My powers.’’  She touches  the silver sickle moon in her ear. ",

" ‘‘Your choice,’’ she says. Sure, he thinks. My choice.",

"Can he find weapons to use against the Nii? <br> <br> The Nii was a greatship. Some of the ships that were traveling with her should still be here. <br> <br> They may be armed. <br> <br> Where are they? ", 

"‘‘I have a map,’’ Tam  says. <br> <br> ‘‘The one the Nii broadcasts?’’ the Priestess asks. <br> <br> The Priestess moves  to sit by him. He shakes his head and passes the map over to her. <br> <br> He looks at her face while  she reads it. She frowns. <br> <br> ‘‘ Too easy?’’  he asks her. <br> <br> She nods. ‘‘It’s part of the Nii’s defense system. It wouldn’t be too intelligent to broadcast an accurate map.’’ ",

"She stands up and wraps the cloak around her.<br> <br> ‘‘I don’t need my powers for everything. If we can get to Central Storage,  there’s an H-class troop transport in one of the pods.  I don’t think it’s damaged. It’s got lasar guns and shields.’’ <br> <br>  ‘‘Any ideas on how we get there?’’ <br><br> ‘‘ I think I can take  control of the Horizator,’’  the Priestess  says <br><br> ‘‘And drive  it manually?’’ Through all the space junk of the Nii? ",

"The Priestess looks up straight at him. She’s still smiling. Right through him her look goes,  desperate  and angry and almost insane. He can’t imagin what being with Brady was like for her. If it  was anything like Circe- <br><br> ‘‘Lead on, virgin,’’ he says. ",

"A swarm of quarocs follow  them through the maze of airtubes. ",

"Through the airtube exit rille they can see the horizator. The door stands open. <br><br> Tam and the Priestess drop out of the airlock grille and throw themselves inside. The door hisses shut. <br><br> The Priestess lays her hand on the control  panel. ",

"She edges the horizator away from the rocky core of the Nii. Tam holds his breath. Pieces of space junk drift past hem in a slow-motion arcade game, coming too  close. The horizatior lights are dim, and Tam can see dark things tumbling against the stars.  <br><br> Up ahead he sees a fragmentary skeleton of girders. <br><br> ‘‘Central Storage,’’ the Priestess identifies it. ‘‘ Dock Four should be close by.’’",

"‘‘Can you program the Nii to kill Brady? He asks. <br><br> ‘‘No. He’s her captain.’’ The priestess relaxes from her concentration. ‘‘In  the ‘69 Rebellion,  one of Nicholsun’s Priestesses killed a captain aboard her ship and reprogrammed the hip to attack Circe prison. Now– I have programming against doing things like that. I can’t take  over a ship or kill her captain  or make the ship kill herself. I can olu serve the ship. Heal her.’’ <br><br> ‘‘What were the Priestesses doing fighting against the Empire?’’ The Priestess smiles faintly. ‘‘We were on the blasphemers’ side. Don’t believe everything you read in the Encyclopedia. The winners wrote it.’’ ",

"They jet forward suddenly to avoid a drifting cargo pod and something  hits the hull, a glancing blow. Tam sees something carom off at an angle, wobbling end over end. The Priestess’s face is lick with sweat. <br><br> Unexpectedly a studded door drifts into their viewport. On the door is the Imperial seal, a sheaf of rice. The horizator’s docking-frapples clang. Metal shrieks as the  little ship slides along the big one. THen, as the dock absorbs their inertia, they come to rest  beside the big ship’s lock. <br><br> The yellow puff-of air icon has reappeared on Tam’s faceplate screen. Now it’s blinking, calling attention to itself. <br><br> The two airlocks snug against each other, and the Priestess opens both doors. With a pop, the horizator’s air dis[erses inside the troop carrier.",

"No lights in the ship, no warmth. The bone-chilling cold of true space. The Priestess’s stars blink out and her skin goes completely dark. Human life cannot survive here; She is breathing from internal storage. <br><br> ‘‘Turn on some lights,’’ he tells her. ",

"All over her body she begins glowing softly. The greenish light reflects off steel, a thick -walled double airlock-two locks, Tam thinks, for decon against the plague. He turns to look at the Priestess and can’t look away. Her  nipples and her lips, the ends of  her nose and her  fingers are  a  darker blue-green; so are her  fingernails and toenails, the  soles  of  ether  feet.  Her hair is  dark; the rest  of  her, greenish  yellow, ghostly, grotesque. <br><br> But for a moment he can imagine making love with a woman who glows. The fantasy is so real he  can feel  her not-quite-human  shin. As he entered her, a visible red glow would spread over his body, everywhere she had toughed it, hot and flickering with firelight. <br><br> He blinks and the fantasy is gone. ‘‘Turn that off. Find some lights,’’ he says harshly.",

"The old lights come on, wavering.<br>,<br> Inside,a narrow corridor. To their left,a crowded control room with space for two pilots. Ahead, a kitchen. <br><br> ‘‘No food,’’ the Priestess says, looking into compartments. <br><br> To  their  right, a padded transport area crowded with pods, now stowed away, but open and rumpled, as though whatever happened in this AV struck in a shipnight. Beyond the transport area is a door leading to the weapons area. A book is abandoned beside the pod. Tam  picks it up idly and touches the screen, which flickers to show a man licking a woman's breasts while she arches back in ecstasy. Tam drops it quickly and looks up to see the Priestess watching him.",

"‘‘It’s cold here,’’ she says. It is space-cold though the heat circuits of his suit are at maximum. The pods look warm, still warmer if two people were in one… She looks like a naked woman covered with  a  thin red silk  cloak, fragile  and crumbling. He can see the faint chitin-like smoothness  of her skin, the sign of the spacehabbed. Her breath does not smock in the cold; the  moisture is being captured and recirculated. <br><br> Emperor’s Daughter. In memory he can still see the  green glow and his answering red one.<br><br> ‘‘Put some more clothes on,’’ he says  roughly. He tosses a thick jacket from one f=of the storage bays across to her, as if that would change things. ‘‘ I'm going to check the controls. We need air and heat.’’ ",

Like the recycling algae on Tam’s ship, the algae here are dead. <br><br> The yellow puff-of-air icon on Tam’s faceplate screen is blinking faster. As he watches it, it brightens and glows steadily, and a smaller wailing tone starrs up in the suit’s internal comm. ",

He holds his breath to try to stop it, but his lungs breathe  for him, his body pushes him aside and works on its own. <br><br> They gasp in rhythm, she pushes breath into his lungs, he pushes back against her breasts, but he can’t stop her. <br><br> His hands begin caressing her breasts, the soft inside of her thighs. She is body to body with him, mouth to mouth, groin to groin.",

He must give her his protection. He needs to be with her always. The smell of  their sex is in the air– the smell– it’s the key to something about himself he didn’t even know, he needs to have it, he needs to rub the smell of her over himself…<br><br> And another part of he mind screams. <br><br> ‘‘So you got what you wanted,’’ he whispers, forcing his bitterness to fight against his need for her.

"She moves in her sleep but doesn’t wake.<br><br> Do the other Red Kings hate the women they serve? <br><br> He has his hearthsblood dagger in his hand… ",

"He tries.<br><br> He tries. <br><br> His hand turns the dagger towards his own chest. <br><br> The dagger falls out of his  hand. <br><br> She has changed him. <br><br> He is hers. ",

"Let out the air. The horizator’s airvent is high, near the ceiling. He punches out the correct sequence. <br><br> There is a whine, then the sudden intense deafness that means vacuum in space.<br><br> Instead of the jolt he expects, the horizator hardly moves. He looks at the digital readout.<br><br> Zero.<br><br> No air, no pressure. ",

"He should be dead.<br><br> His  sin chills. <br><br> He  exhales:  no plume of moisture. He  inhales. In vacuum. <br><br> Of course. She spacehabs her lovers, doesn’t she? The better  to have them die for her. <br><br> But that was fast? Changed that fast to what she needed?",

"He shakes her. She opens her eyes. Somehow she is older now. She  looks  straight into his  eyes. He  holds himself back dizzily from falling diip into  them, from  simply accepting whatever  she has for him. <br><br> ‘‘ You screwed me and spacehabbed me.’’ He hears his own  voice tinny through  his suit controls.  She replies in the same wavelength. <br><br> ‘‘You’re more in danger now. Brady told Nii to  kill  you after I had you.’’ <br><br> ‘‘After I  had you…’  Fuck the Emperor’s Mother! Didn’t I have anything to say about it?’’<br><br> She shakes her head. ‘‘No.’’ ",

"‘‘So you thought I’d be happy once I did it. Did you persuade yourself that I’d be a happy little kickass fo the Emperor, once I’d screwed you? How long before I lose my memory? Before I think I always loved the Emperor? And you?’’ <br><br> She shakes  her  head again. ",

" ‘‘You’ve  killed me!’’ he  crise out. He  raises his  hand  to  her  but he can’t strike her, and the  knowledge that  he can  never strike  her makes him turn and drive  his strong Red  King guardian fist at the horizator wall, again and  again. It makes only a jar, no sound. ",

"He slumps against the horizator  wall. She  moves to  touch  him. He jerks away.  ",

"‘‘I’m going to reprogram the ship,’’ she says.<br><br> ‘‘For  the Emperor. Go on. Go ahead.’’ <br><br> She  touches the horixator control  panel. Under her fingers  it changes. Rows of  buttons, some dark, some blinking orange, a surprising few their normal  colors  of  blue and green. ",

"‘‘See what you can find to help us.’’ <br><br> Oh yes, Mistress, I hear and obey ",

"‘‘Tis is all Terran propaganda,’’ Tam Rosse says.<br><br> The Priestess turns briefly to look at the wall. <br><br> ‘‘Give it my clearance number. AP7829044P’’ ",

"This  time there’s only one line.<br><br> Encyclopedia Galactica:  index (entries  selection as immediately relevant) <br><br> ‘‘Nicholsun’s Plague’’ *** CLASSIFIED MATERIAL  – TERRANS ONLY***   ",

"Nicholsun’s Virus or Plague<br><br> The origin of the Nicholsun’s Virus, or Nicholsun’s  Plague, is  to be  found  in  the genetics of small populations. Without intervention, small populations rapidly lose genetic identity with their  ancestors. To maintain a common  geen pool, breeding programs and mutation control are vital,  especially  in area if high background radiation, Crossbreeding is also a necessity.<br><br> During the early stages of the settlement of the Astroids, it  was  realized that genetic updating would become a necessary part of the  health of each Asteroid  ITC. ",

"About sixty-five years ago a man named Harry Nicholsun bid for and received the contract to update the ITC’s genetic pool. It  was a hazardous job, because it often meant being exposed to, and exposing other to, new diseases, as well  as introducing new genes into  the pool. <br><br> On the surface, Nicholsun’s contribution to the  Asteroid culture  seemed innocuous  if a little crude. Nicholsun  was fortunate to start his business at the time  when live pronographic theater was bein greplaced by  3D sense-linked vids (illusions). He could call on a wide range of live-theater actors, most of  whom would go  anywhere and do  anything.<br><br> Nicholsun linked genetic distribution to sex. ",

"Nicholsun  Raves began with Prayer and ceremonies, feasting, intoxication, and fireworks; they ended in mass celebration and the spread of new germplasm throughout  the ship. Their ceremonial center was the Priestess, a nubile, sensual woman who performed nacked except for her sacred glowing tattoos. Her consort was the Red Man or Red King. Invariably a condemned criminal, the Red King was chosen for his strength, sill with weapons, adn virility, and was bound to the Priestess for life by ‘‘secret ceremonies.’’ <br><br> Drawn from the uneducated parts of society and cut off from Terran culture by the sterility of the Asteroids, Asteroid dwellers eagerly sought the color and excitement that ‘‘Great-day’’ provided. A few comparatively sophisticated minds thought they saw through to Nicholsun’s secret. For them, the priestess and her Consort were simply and assistant genetic  engineer and her bodyguard. Of course – until  far too late – they did not see wah Nicholsun was doing at all.",

"More surprisingly, of the Terran officials who dealt  with Nicholsun, only one suspected this treachery. Lieut. Gregor Marczak, a minor official in the Genetics Bureau on Pallas, realized the  truth when he observed  his own extreme emotional reaction to a Priestess’s visit in San-gatsu 867.<br><br> Nicholsun had  not merely distributed genetic material; he had changed it. He had contaminated almost the  entire genetic pool of the Asteroids with a sensitivity to a rho-pheromone he himself had engineered.  <br><br> Nicholsun  pioneered the concept of pheromonic linkage.",

"His terrible plot depended on two linked stages of infection. The first generation of victims were infected by a rhinovirus, which modified cells in the nasopharyngeal passages. The  modified cells responded strongly to a kingship pheromone, developed by Nicholsun  and  given  off by his  genetically modified  Priestesses and Red Kings. Stem cells were not affected and, as the modified cells died, the effect eventually wore off.  But  the virus remained among the Asteroids, modifying itself like a cold  virus, so that the population was subject to  frequent reinfections.<br><br> The second infection was more insidious and more lasting. It entered the body through sexual contact and lived silently in the blood. On the first generation it had no apparent effect. But insidiously, in sperm and egg, it altered the very genetics of the population. On the children of  the first generation, it produced the same effect as the rhinovirus and on the first. <br><br> Permanently. ",

"The effect on the victims was blind, loving loyalty to Nicholsun and all of his subordinates– who were genetically modified to emit the rho-pheromone, but who could not  pass that modification. <br><br> In other words, Nicholsun had created a new species, a race of workers genetically engineered for loyalty. Red Kings  were pheromonically linked to their Priestesses. Priestesses and Kings, in turn, were pheromonicalyy linked to Nicholsun himself. <br><br> Smell is an unanswerable argument. The  rhinocephalon, the part of the brain governing smell, is one of the oldest parts of the brain, unchanged since the reptiles. No one could resist a Priestess or a Red King. Intellectual convictions, no matter how sincerely held, simply made no difference.  During the Riots  of 869, infected Terran officials laid down their lives to protect anti-Terran Priestesses and Red Kings. Ironically, one of those was Marczak himself, shot for treason. ",

"Nicholsun was executed at Castra Martis in 873. But by the time his ultimate treachery was punished, the modifications had spread too far. Most of  the adults thin living on the Asteroid Stations were carriers. All so their children- and Nucholsun’s raves had produced many children– carried the genetic plague. <br><br> Now, incapable of democracy, incapable of rational thought, when their rulers are present, the populations of the Asteroids live in limbo. The plague has expressed  itself in three generations of these unfortunate beings. The Asteroid population has been allowed to  drop precipitously. <br><br> The large Hermes-Eccentric cargo ships, once the lifeblood of the Asteroids, have almost all been moved to Sunward orbits, sense Asteroids trade involves the risk of genetic contamination.",

"Unless the Plague is cured, all of the population of the Asteroids  will be  allowed  to die. <br><br> The  most stringent  precautions are taken  to avoid contact between the true Terran stock  and  the Asteroid dwellers, who can  merely be called humanlike. These necessary precautions  have led to  several Nicholsun alone, is to blame for these deaths. <br><br> Ironically, Nicholsun’s false ‘‘religion’’ is now the only hope for the Asteroid dwellers. Terran technology has made the role of Priestesses and Red Kings a benevolent one. The  Priestess, moving from asteroid  to dying asteroid, is now a terran genetic techneition , carrying with her the latest experimental  weapons against Nicholsun’s plague. Today she is pheromonically linked, not  to a mad dictator, but to the Terran bureaucracy and  to the welfare of  the ship or outpost she serves.  ",

"She and her Red King,  still her protector in these wild  outposts, link her Asteroid  swellers genetically with their Terran  cousins. Operation Asteroid. They  add all improvements to algae, flora, fauna– all the benefits  of  continuing Terran  arcocultue– to the arcology of  each Asteroid. <br><br> Up to  the present. No one has  found a way of  reversing the effects of Nicholsun’s plague. But the search continues. Someday the Asteroid  dwellers will be freed of this curse. Someday they will be full members of the human race again. ",
