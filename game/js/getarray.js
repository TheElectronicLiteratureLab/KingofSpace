"It is a  place of unimaginable  emptiness. In 690 billion square miles, only three asteroids can support a Class A town: Pallas the Whorehouse,  Circe the prison, and Ceres the Bureaucracy. From these three asteroids, hidden  behind  glass screens  and virus filters, the Terran administrators try to hold a territory  larger than all of the empire.   <br> The Independent Trading Colonies scratch out a living in Beltspace. Each ITC supports perhaps 50 to 100 humans. But between the ITCs and the three, there is emptiness, desertion, and silence. <br> 50 years ago, it was different.  But then the Incarnations came, the Priestess and the Red King…  <br>  And after them, the Plague…",// 1

"Year 919 of the Empire. On his dying spaceboat,  Tam Ross dreams… <br> He is back on ITC 3502, curled up  in the sleeping pod he shares with his mother. His mother is a very important person,  a watchman at the WaterCenter. Their pod hangs by the big water tanks. <br> He is an important person too. <br>  He cracks  open the sleeping pod and sniffs the cool fresh air. The auxiliary lights flicker dimly. The sunlights are still off. In a tiny spotlight, the sacred puppet of  the Rice Emperor dances in the wind from the air vents.", //2 (corner image)

"Tam touches the edge of the sleeping pod and wriggles out the seam. The cool damp air raises goosebumps on his skin. He runs over the prickly- grassed nutrient floor and climbs up the ladder to the biggest tank. <br> He jumps in and begins swimming among the koi,  in the cold early-morning water, and the big fish rub their bodies against his and kiss him, asking for food.", // 3 (sleeping pod image ?) 

"But in the dream, the Rice Emperor reaches up to his puppet frame and breaks the strings that hold him. He strides across the air toward Tam, across the surface of the water. He stands on the water, glaring with rage, pointing at Tam, and the Imperial Soldiers surround them. <br> <i>'Blasphemer! Traitor!' </i> <br> He grabs Tam tight by the left hand and draws his fingernail across the complex gene-tattoo that covers Tam's palm. The tattoo that shows his plague resistance. The pain claws at Tam's chest and he cannot breath. the gene-tattoo bubbles and burst.", //4(corner image)

"He wakes up gasping. <br> The oxygen depletion alarm is wailing. Every gasp is a knife in his lungs. <br> He cannot remember for a moment which auxiliary oxygen tanks are still unused. He flicks switches clumsily with his left hand.  <br> One tank left.",//6

"His eyes blur as he tries to read nav charts. He is only twenty-tree but his hands shake as he keys in chart coordinates. <br> He remembers his dream and smiles mirthlessly. They burned his hand on Pallas, trying to make him give names of the others who were trying to breed Plague resistance. Some Priestess's slave-King burned the gene tattoo off his palm, skin, nerves  and all. He clenches and unclenches it, holding his anger in his bad hand. <br> There is no inhabited asteroid within a halfmonth, not even a miner's claim. And he has less that a shipday worth of air.", //7

"The radar beacon has locked on to something. <br> Barely visible, a shadow-shape blocks the stars. <br> Eternal Mother! - it's a ship. An old one, and huge. <br> It's the size of a Class A town, a great irregular cloud of modules and environments, furred with the junk of a thousand System journeys, revolving around itself in a vast complexity of orbits. At its edges he can see the stars though the cloud, but in its center the pods swarm so thickly that the ship looks like a single vast solid object. <br> And it is dark. No lights shine from it: no red warning lamps, no yellow haze of sunlights.",//8

The little white moon can restock an entire planet. <br> It can restock a Greatship.",//11

" But there will be a crew. <br> A Priestess and her Red King. The chief Imperial servants in the Asteroids. <br> The Priestess with her powers controls life and death in the Rocks.

"She is encased in a half moon of ice, and sparkles of silver ray out from her body. Her skin is the dusky color of twilight  on the Fertile Worlds, and on it, faintly, glow stars. Piercing her right ear is a silver earring in the shape of a sickle moon.", // 14

"The Priestess. But there is no Red King with her. <br><br> Tam's head echoes with the warm bass tones of the Scriptures he heard as a child and no longer believes in. <br><br> &emsp; <i>The Emperor mated with Terra, and their Daughter was Space.<br> &emsp; Space is a virgin whose skin is dark and whose body is coverd with <br> &emsp; stars. The moon hangs in her ear. In her womb are all the seeds of life...</i><br><br> The halo of silver seeds extends through the ice around her. In that gel is the genetic code of everything from algae to humans. On Venus, criminals  kill to get algae. Algae make oxygen; you can eat algae. With algae you can  live. <br><br> Where is her Red King?",//15

"Where is the poor bastard? <br><br> &emsp; <i> Because she was lonely for a lover, she made a man out of Mars-dust, and by concours with her in the ceremony he gaind life.

"He sould be on the couch,<br>  frozen in the coldsleep gel<br> with her.",//17

"Tam's neck chills. This Priestess is still wearing the Virgin's Moon. <br><br> Her earring is  a thin  sickle of silver, a virgin's earring. Until the opening of her womb she has no powers.<br><br> The Priestesses  get their ''powers'' through computer linkage, and the linking-up happens during her sexual initiation. A Priestess on her virgin voyage finds a man and mates with him. After sex, she  gets  her powers. Sex is magic.<br><br> But during the sex- this is a bad religion- the Priestess infects her lover with  the most virulent form of Plague. Whoever she finds, the poor bastard becomes her Red King. Her bodyguard. Totally, fanatically, dedicated to her. <br><br> Mated to Space? No. Mated to her. For life.",//18

"Tam Rosse looks down at his red prison jumpsuit and grins wryly. The Red King.<br> &emsp; <i> And all who love the Emporer's Saughter shall know and love the Emperor.</i> <br> He makes his sacred left hand into  a fist. Nothing makes him love the Emperor. But he needs the Priestess's knowledge.",//19

//22 ch1 The Ceremony ritual is just an excuse; removing the earring is the key to her powers. He'll try that, then talk with her rationally.

"Tam Rosses reaches through the ''ice '' and tries to slip the earring out of her ear. <br><br> It  won't move. <br><br> The half-mmon  of ice  turns into water, rivulets flowing down into  the surface of the egg-ship. There is a flash of great hear, a warmth and wetness. Tam Rosse breaks  into a sweat. The girl opens her eyes and reaches  up her  hand  to her ear. <br><br> Her eyes are utterly black. <br><br>  Is the Ceremony all rational? look into her eyes...  ",//20

"She looks  around her, confused still stunned from the coldsleep drugs. It has been such a long dreaming. Standing over her is a man in red. <br> ''-You?'' the man in red says. <br><br> You... The word is strange. It means her. She looks tentatively down at her arms, at her naked breasts. Her skin is dark and across it are freckled little stars. Funny. They mean something. So does his red suit. She  thinks of a pary- something- St. Nicholsun's Days on Pallas. ''Are you Saint Nicholsun?'' she says triumphantly.<br><br> She can fell his eyes like a rough hand on her skin. He turns away. ''You've lost your  memory. It happens sometimes in cold sleep,'' he  says. ''You'll get it back.'' " ,//21

"''I know who I am,'' she says. '' I'm Aster. I'm supposed to go to a party. it's called the Ceremony.'' <br><br> She  looks down at her body again. All over she is shaped like a grownup. She frowns. She touches she strange round breasts. They bob and tug as she gets up, and there is some king of ID stud in her ear, something that hurts and tingles. They have something to do with the party.<br><br> She is afraid of the Ceremony, somehow.<br><br> ''Lets look in the ship,''  the man says.",//22

"He goes in front of her, Propelling himself down a snaky corridor. It is dark and she is afraid. she asks him to wait for her while she looks for a suit, but he tells her she dosen't need one. '' Not you. Your're spacehabbed.'' <br><br> ''What does that mean?'' <br><br> ''It means you're important,'' he says roughly. ''Almost as good as a Terran.'' <br><br> He takes her by the arm and leads her down the cooridor. In  his other hand he holds some kind of dagger, like a dress-up for St. Nicholsun's. He gesturees to the lock. <br><br> There are frost-flowers around the massive old doors. she remembers not to touch froseted metal, but to put her hand only on the touchplate.",//23

"Her fingers seem to work by themselves, and through the metal of the ship they feel a vibration. <br><br> The lock-picture makes a pattern and the door unlocks for her. <br><br> It's nice feeling, like a tickling, like a koi kissing her hand. <br><br> She feels the ship somehow. She almost smells it.",//24

"Inside the airlock waits an old,old man.",//31

"Bugs crawl  in his hair and his skin is yellow-gray. Even in the thin air by the airlock, he smells like old dirt. <br><br> But he is a captain, because he has an wire crown on his head. <br><br> ''I am king,'' he says, staring at Aster. <br><br> His red jumpsuit, stiff with dirt, hangs on his body. He scratches at his withered crotch. He plucks at the Imperial name-patch and looks at it curiousley as though it is the instructions for a machine he does not use. <br><br> ''I am King Brady.'' ",//29

"''Priestess?'' The old man says. He looks at her strangely. <br><br> ''No,'' she says. ''Aster. Not a Priestess.'' Priestesses are grownups.<br><br> ''You folks tradin''? <br><br> Trade? She looks more closely at the dirty old man.",//30

"She knows about trade. Trade means presents. <br><br> When the trading ships come  in,  a little girl on  Pall'  can get a present just by asking. <br><br> ''Will you give me a present?'' she asks the old man.<br><br> The old man laughs strangely <br><br> ''Honey, I'll do you a favor.''",//31

"''You can't do that!'' the other man yells.''She's lost her memory.''<br><br> ''shut up boy. She asked. I got some wine,'' the old man says.''Huney, you ever tasted wine?'' <br><br> No, she has never tasted wine. How could she at four years old? The old man  sets the strange candle down. The quavering light speckles the top of a dust-covered storcube and glimmers on something more wonderful than she has ever seen.<br><br> The metal of the cup has a sheen, all over, like her own skin. The cup is heacy, covered with crystals that spark like stars on her sin. She picks it up, delighted. <br><br> The other man tries to knock it away from her!",//32

"''Who picks it up  drinks it,'' the oldman says. ''That's part of Ceremony. Hey?'' <br><br> She doesn’t know what he means, but she drinks from the cup. <br><br> The wine is strange, choking. She coughs. It tastes of incense. <br><br> Incense... the smell of bodies together, a crowd...<br><br> Barefooted on the swirl-patterned steel of the Palladion, a  crowd of girls, Priestess-virgins, practicing for  the Ceremony, tasting  the wine. Taste of plums and fermentation, cumin, nutmeg, cannabis, the sting of the alcohol against the roof of the mouth...<br><br> She remembers.",//33

"The cup loosens from her hand and drops.<br><br> And the old man, snatching it from  her, drinks the last drops of the cup. <br><br><br> ''No!'' she cries.", //34

"The old man holds out his hand.  His nails are black ridged claws. Between his fingers are seams of dirt. ''Take your King's hand,'' he says. She shudders back.<br><br> The young man protests.  '' She didn't remember. You forced a favor on her.''  <br><br> ''No force, boy.'' <br><br> She turns to look at the man in red. The young man, the fertile man. She can hardly bear to look at him without touching him. <br><br> To have given herself to the other one is blasphemy. He is too old to be fertile. Mother Eternal, what will she do?",//35

"And she doesn't have her powers until - How can a priestess make fertility, until her own body is a seed? <br><br> ''You can't be my King,'' she gasps to the old man. <br><br> Her breast and groin ache and the silver earring weighs heavy in her ear.<br><br> ''Well, girl, s'pose we try.''",//36

"She turns and takes the young man's hand. She holds it desperately, not daring to look at him, feeling only his tight strength. <br><br> How can her word be as important as her life?<br><br> ''I  have given you a favor. I will fix hour ship.  Give me this man for servant.''<br><br> Her body confuses her with its longing. <br><br> The old man looks at her shrewdly. <br><br> ''He'll serve  you in the day,'' he says.  ''But in the night, I.''",//37

"He starts to repair the Water Center. <br><br> Teh big transparent water-globes are chocked with dying algae. The sunlights have dimmed, flickering, dying. The filters leak water onto the nutrient floor.<br><br> She has only half her powers. The ship needs more knowledge than she has, and  the silver earringhangs heavy in her ear.",//38

"She sends Tam Rosse to look for new filters. <br><br> Servant. Her servant. <br><br> Eyes follow them everywhere.<br><br> Stationaly cameras, skittering watch bots. A spyfly crawls over her ear, looking at the earring. <br><br> They are like flies on the bodies of the dead.",//39 pic of the watercenter  

"At night she goes to Brady. <br><br>  She closes her eyes and endures. But at the end she is as she was before and the silver sickle earring will not drop form her ear. <br><br> In the dark, she plants seeds in the nutrient floor, but nothing growns under her hands. <br><br> Only the Ceremony plant.",//40

"The first shipday, the Ceremony plant is as high as her belly. <br><br> ''Give me a favor from that plant,'' Tam Rosse says. <br><br> She gives him  the smollest of the unfurling green leaces. He kneels and holds it in his hand, a green thing  in all this dead grayness. He looks at her and their eyes meet while they might count one. <br><br> What good is her word on this dying ship?<br><br> Thy clean the old filters. Thy find in them the skeletons of koi. She re-balances the chemistry of the hydroponics gargen. <br><br> That night. Brady comet o her, but he cannot take the earring from her ear.",//41

"The next shipday the Ceremony plant is as high as her heart. <br><br> ''Give me a favor from that plant,'' Tam Rosse says again.<br><br> She gives him a branch with a spray of green leaces. He  holds it in his hand, and they smells the scent of its life in the dead and decay-smelling ship. Tam Rosses looks at her, and their eyes meen while they might count three. <br><br> What good is her word? It was tricked from her. ",//42

"They clean dead algae from the tanks. Tam Rosse fixes valves and clears a pipe. They start the aerator in the big open tank. They water runs blear but dead. <br><br>  They look at it together and do not look at eachother. They say nothing.<br><br> That night Brady comet to her, but he cannot take the earring from her ear.<br><br>''Let me go to him,'' she pleads with the old man.<br><br>''Girl, I been waiting so long. Trained to be a Red King. You chose  me.''<br><br> He smells of dust and rotten onions. He is flabby and limp. He is old.",//43

"On the third shipday the Ceremony plant is as high as her silver earring. <br><br> ''Give me a favor from that plant,''  Tam Rosses says again.<br><br> The Ceremony flowers have opened, red soft funnels of flower in around whirl of leaves. Their scent is like a summer night on the Fertile Worlds. <br><br> The buzz she hears could be insects in those summer fields; but it is a spyfly. Does the ship control them, or does King Brady? Which of them can hear whatever she says?",//44

"The aerator monitors in the Water Center pound like hearts. She is the heart of the ship, and it  beats, it beats. <br><br> ''A favor?''  she asks, and gives Tam Rosses...",//45

"She snatches the spyfly out of the air. ''Go tell your master I brock my word!'' she whispers to it and crushes it. <br><br> And there is no buzz in the air,  no summer fields, only the scent of Ceremony flowers, and of him, ''I give you all my favor,'' she mummers in to his ear. The red Ceremony blossoms fall on them as they lie under the tree. The red is the color of his discarded jumpsuit, and she laughs, drunk with joy, as they lie together.  <br><br> She draws her  fingers across  his  palm and his wound  heals. <br><br>He loosens the silver earring form  her earlobe. <br><br> She is the ship and the ship is living. The ship is a speck in her  belly and she is lying with her lover in t he belly of the ship.",//46

"When she wakes up it is snowing in the ship.<br><br>  The plants are growing underneath the snow. The snow dazzles at the edges; it is illusion. <br><br> But  it is a cruel illusion, a strong one. Ice forms on the water-tanks. The koi struggle as the water greexes. The great tanks strain and crack, and a cold wind screams as the doors iris open.",//47

"The Priestess finds herself standing  in a hall made of ice. The wind keens through the ship as  if  the steel of the ship is crying. <br><br>''Oh my  lover! The  Captain is dead.'' <br><br> A red-clothed man lies dead on  a bier. He is pale all over, blue with cold. <br><br>Oh my lover! <br><br> But it is King Brady.",//48

"A woman stands over him, an old Japanese woman. Her hair whirls around her, Ice-crystals and now. Her kimono is broken mirrors, the sing of unfaithfulness.<br><br> ''I an the Lady Nii,'' says the Ship.<br><br> ''Your King is dead,'' says the Lady Nill,  raising her wrinkled face. ''My Captain-lover of many  years waited for you, Priestess. When you came you would not have him.You took a young lover. My Captain, my lover died of a broken heart.''",//49

"The Ship passes her wrinkled palm across the dead mans hair. She lifts the power crown frim his dead forehead. <br><br> ''I am linked to you  now,'' the Priestess says. ''We both carry life because of the Ceremony.''<br><br>  The old woman recoils. She passes her  fan across the Priestess's stomach, and her fan is made of broken mirrors.",//50

"''Your lover has left you a child, and you want to make gardens in my belly. Your child will necer nurse form me or wear the powercrown. Your lover is the dung in  your  gardens, and your child shall  die, and  you will starve while your gardens crumble to dust.'' <br><br> the old woman puts the power crown on her own wild hait. <br><br> ''I am steel. Why do I need gardens? I will support human life no more.''",//51

"In the Water Center it is cold.",//55

"Nii dose not speak to her, not even through illusions. <br><br> The ship's grief is like a steel wall",//53

"From this steel winter, The Priestess forces spring. <br><br> She programs the local computer to rotate the sunlights<br><br> The cold retreats. <br><br> Her hands shape the nutriment around the sprouts, balance the chemistry of the water gardens. In the smaller tanks, algae drift. Nori ripple their wide leaves into the cold salt water.",//54

"Food and air grow under her hands. Shrimp, kelp, plankton, oranges, sunfood, breadfruit. Ripe tomatos with  their dust-smellignleaces. Beans and green clover, that keep the nitrogen in the soil and give her air to breath. <br><br> The Priestess's child pushes upward in her womb, marking the days.",//55

"Sometimes she cannot tell herself from the ship.<br><br> Tam has put seeds in both their wombs, and the ship is breeding fish, her womb is full of food, air, flowers. She is her own lifeship, a round mountain, a seedling, a waxing planet.",//56

"One day, as  the Priestess swims  in the tank, she feels a wave that starts in her belly. It is  pain and excitement at once. She rides it, panting. <br><br> There are handles at the side of the tank. She grasps  them and  floats in the water, bracing herself against the waves. <br><br> One by one she rides them and they course through her body, pulling at her like the moon. She si opening  herself like a ripe fruit. The leaves come closer and closer together, more quickly, higher, immense. She is enormous, fragile, as tenuous as Mars' atmosphere, streching over the living planet of ther baby.",//57

"And Death comes walking toward her across the waves.<br><br> Death is a belly full of nightmares, a belly that bulges and twists under gray skin. Waves slap painfully against the Priestess's straining womb. The Koi rise to the surface and kiss Death's feet, and shudder and float on the surface. Brown water pumps out of Death's womb in to irrigation system and the brownness spreads in the the plants and turns them sickly and yellow. Their leaves droop. <br><br> ''Healer,'' says Death, ''did you forgetme?''",//58

"The waves come form outside her now, faster, faster, she can't breathe, they won't stop long enough for her to breath. <br><br>Death grabs her in muscular arms, holds her against Deaths taut belly, womb to womb. Death's heavy-laboring belly tightens, tightens, and the Priestess screams but the tightness spreads over her belly too, she is choking, drowning, splitting apart. <br><br> The water draws back  from her, roaring and the final wave of pain comes, hangs over her head, her whole body convulses with the pain and the fear of it, and then the wave hits, all at once, and tumbles her to darkness.",//59

"She is  floating  in something liquid, cradling, warm. She opens her eyes. A tiny koi swims past, gold-scailed snd gold-finned, blurry in the water; It swivels around on itself and returns to kiss at her skin. She is in the WaterCenter, floating in the big open tank. The sunlights are woking. <br><br> She crawls out of the tank. She is the first land animal that  ever was, weak and clumsy. Exhausted, she sits on the nutrient floor, feeling  her body, running water-wrinkled hands over brests and belly. Her breast are painful but not much swollen yet. Her nipples are still a virgi's soft comes. Behind her groin-bone she can barely feel the hard ball of her womb, rising like a baby's fist. <br><br> The Nii has given her illusions to frighten her.  <br><br> Months yet  before  she bears  her child.",//60

"But still Nii, the Lady Nii, stands above her, wearing her kimono of broken glass. Nii slaps her naked lup-swollen belly,  where nightnars crawl under the skin. The old woman squats down, rubbing at her back as if she is about to  birth  her nightnares. She squints at the Priestess. <br><br> ''Fertility,'' she says, ''is your excuse for everything. You humans spread like a virus out of your planet. You infected your own moon, Venus, Mars. You came out here to the Asteroids, where you can barely live. <br><br> ''To reproduce yourselves here, you humans had to carry your genes ouside your bodies. You had to trade genes, calculate which to combine to keep your colonies going. Your gene pool got infected, so you humans cut it like a sore away form your bodies. And you left all your infected  here to die. You have no morality. You brace only this sickness of life.''",//61

"''You killed my Captain-lover form grief because he was not fertile, and took another man only because he was. <br><br>''You created me to be your servant. You infect me. I have lived with you so long, I am leprosied by you.''",//62

Last night's was a kiss.''<br><br> ''I will tell you about breast cancer and wombs that dry up. I will tell you about children  that  die  and children thay hate. I  will say that your lover does not love you,  does not  want to serve your body; that he will take a ship one day and go to fight in a bigger ear. You  will belive  me  more  every day. I will say he loves power and hates you. I will make you smell shit form the diesease that kills you. Your tounge will tast the sourness of your dying. Fertile Priestess, every flower that frows under  your hand will be a fear.''",//63

"The Priestess reaches over, a little clumsily because the balance of her body is already changing, and brushes her fingers over the low sprouts of her  garden. <br><br> ''Fool,'' says Nii. The old woman rubs ner belly and small monsters birth form her, slither down her legs like poisonous  liquid.  Their claws scrabble away the nurtient floor  and  uproot  the seedlings; thorough the torn floor the steel shines. <br><br> The Priestess take a deep breath. Though the distruction she can see the garden undisturbed.''Your illusions do not frighten  me.''<br><br> Nii grunt and pushes to her feet. Her protruding belly still writhes. She spreads her legs. An immense redness gushes out of her. <br><br> A man, red-clothed, limp. It  is Tam Rosse. ",//64

"The Priestess cries out and kneels by Tam.<br><br> The Nii is nothing now but a mirror, a reflection crowned with a crown of gold wires. She shakes the  power crown down like some strange fruit onto Tam;shead. <br><br> ''Here is your  Captain. I birthed him like a child. I have given him the power crown, and he will take power from you. He will not trust you because  you are part of the Empire. In the end he will run form you, scorning the food and the are you have given him, the children you bear, because he knows you did not choose anything you have done. <br><br>''You are programmed, in your genes and your fertility, and he knows it.''

"Nii vanishes. <br><br> They are alone, in the Water Center. The Priestess sits, Tam's head cradled in her lap. In her belly, the child is  already a third peron with them.<br><br> Who will the child be? Aster of Pallas, a four-year-old girl, who snatched at a cup of wine? A girl who knew on oldman's life counted less thatn a lover's? A woman who can choose nightmares? For a momne she looks around in panic. <br><br> What drives up? What made us cme to this empty place, these steel walls, to drive ourselves in to the airless belly of space? <br><br> But this is not a question she can ask of steel. ",//66

A pillow-bed in the center of the room is mashed down and disarranged. It looks like sex  that has gon on too long, too dispiritedly. The room smells of Brady’s stink. <br> <br> Tam looks up at the ceiling, finds concealed wing nuts. He pushes the trap door upward. ‘‘ Airtube,’’ he explains. He tosses her the cloak again and this time she puts it on. ", 

"The air tubing smells like old plastic. It is only about four feet in diameter: stiff, black, and accordion-pleated stuff that flexes as they hoist themselves through the trapdoor and crouch in it. <br> <br> ‘‘The Nii can’t reach  us here,’’ Tam explains, ‘‘any more than you can reach inside your veins.  She can’t hear us or see us.  We’ve disappeared.’’ ",

 "‘‘She’ll come  after us,’’ the Priestess says. <br> <br> ‘‘Sure. But she  dosen’t  know where to find  us.’’  Tam squint  down the long  black  tube. ‘‘Airtube’s the safest place to hide out. No spybots. Union law.’’ <br> <br> ‘‘Union– ?’’ The Priestess looks curiously at his new scar though the transparent glove of his skintite. He polarizes the gloves  dark so she can’t see her work. <br> <br> ‘‘Yeah. I was a good Union airtube  repairman. Then I was  a terrorist. Then I was in  the cold mines on Circe. Thant’s me.’’ ",//(blocks around the edges)

"‘‘I  could  change Nii’s programming,’’ the Priestess says. <br> <br> he looks at  her. ‘‘How?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘If I can get into core memory. I could change your status  too. Give you Ship’s Favor so she  won’t kill you.’’  <br> <br> ‘‘What do you need?’’ <br> <br> ‘‘My powers.’’  She touches  the silver sickle moon in her ear. ",

"Can he find weapons to use against the Nii? <br> <br> The Nii was a greatship. Some of the ships that were traveling with her should still be here. <br> <br> They may be armed. <br> <br> Where are they? ", 

"‘‘I have a map,’’ Tam  says. <br> <br> ‘‘The one the Nii broadcasts?’’ the Priestess asks. <br> <br> The Priestess moves  to sit by him. He shakes his head and passes the map over to her. <br> <br> He looks at her face while  she reads it. She frowns. <br> <br> ‘‘ Too easy?’’  he asks her. <br> <br> She nods. ‘‘It’s part of the Nii’s defense system. It wouldn’t be too intelligent to broadcast an accurate map.’’ ",

"She stands up and wraps the cloak around her.<br> <br> ‘‘I don’t need my powers for everything. If we can get to Central Storage,  there’s an H-class troop transport in one of the pods.  I don’t think it’s damaged. It’s got lasar guns and shields.’’ <br> <br>  ‘‘Any ideas on how we get there?’’ <br><br> ‘‘ I think I can take  control of the Horizator,’’  the Priestess  says <br><br> ‘‘And drive  it manually?’’ Through all the space junk of the Nii? ",

"The Priestess looks up straight at him. She’s still smiling. Right through him her look goes,  desperate  and angry and almost insane. He can’t imagin what being with Brady was like for her. If it  was anything like Circe- <br><br> ‘‘Lead on, virgin,’’ he says. ",

"A swarm of quarocs follow  them through the maze of airtubes. ",

"Through the airtube exit rille they can see the horizator. The door stands open. <br><br> Tam and the Priestess drop out of the airlock grille and throw themselves inside. The door hisses shut. <br><br> The Priestess lays her hand on the control  panel. ",

"She edges the horizator away from the rocky core of the Nii. Tam holds his breath. Pieces of space junk drift past hem in a slow-motion arcade game, coming too  close. The horizatior lights are dim, and Tam can see dark things tumbling against the stars.  <br><br> Up ahead he sees a fragmentary skeleton of girders. <br><br> ‘‘Central Storage,’’ the Priestess identifies it. ‘‘ Dock Four should be close by.’’",

"‘‘Can you program the Nii to kill Brady? He asks. <br><br> ‘‘No. He’s her captain.’’ The priestess relaxes from her concentration. ‘‘In  the ‘69 Rebellion,  one of Nicholsun’s Priestesses killed a captain aboard her ship and reprogrammed the hip to attack Circe prison. Now– I have programming against doing things like that. I can’t take  over a ship or kill her captain  or make the ship kill herself. I can olu serve the ship. Heal her.’’ <br><br> ‘‘What were the Priestesses doing fighting against the Empire?’’ The Priestess smiles faintly. ‘‘We were on the blasphemers’ side. Don’t believe everything you read in the Encyclopedia. The winners wrote it.’’ ",

"They jet forward suddenly to avoid a drifting cargo pod and something  hits the hull, a glancing blow. Tam sees something carom off at an angle, wobbling end over end. The Priestess’s face is lick with sweat. <br><br> Unexpectedly a studded door drifts into their viewport. On the door is the Imperial seal, a sheaf of rice. The horizator’s docking-frapples clang. Metal shrieks as the  little ship slides along the big one. THen, as the dock absorbs their inertia, they come to rest  beside the big ship’s lock. <br><br> The yellow puff-of air icon has reappeared on Tam’s faceplate screen. Now it’s blinking, calling attention to itself. <br><br> The two airlocks snug against each other, and the Priestess opens both doors. With a pop, the horizator’s air dis[erses inside the troop carrier.",

"No lights in the ship, no warmth. The bone-chilling cold of true space. The Priestess’s stars blink out and her skin goes completely dark. Human life cannot survive here; She is breathing from internal storage. <br><br> ‘‘Turn on some lights,’’ he tells her. ",

"All over her body she begins glowing softly. The greenish light reflects off steel, a thick -walled double airlock-two locks, Tam thinks, for decon against the plague. He turns to look at the Priestess and can’t look away. Her  nipples and her lips, the ends of  her nose and her  fingers are  a  darker blue-green; so are her  fingernails and toenails, the  soles  of  ether  feet.  Her hair is  dark; the rest  of  her, greenish  yellow, ghostly, grotesque. <br><br> But for a moment he can imagine making love with a woman who glows. The fantasy is so real he  can feel  her not-quite-human  shin. As he entered her, a visible red glow would spread over his body, everywhere she had toughed it, hot and flickering with firelight. <br><br> He blinks and the fantasy is gone. ‘‘Turn that off. Find some lights,’’ he says harshly.",

"The old lights come on, wavering.<br>,<br> Inside,a narrow corridor. To their left,a crowded control room with space for two pilots. Ahead, a kitchen. <br><br> ‘‘No food,’’ the Priestess says, looking into compartments. <br><br> To  their  right, a padded transport area crowded with pods, now stowed away, but open and rumpled, as though whatever happened in this AV struck in a shipnight. Beyond the transport area is a door leading to the weapons area. A book is abandoned beside the pod. Tam  picks it up idly and touches the screen, which flickers to show a man licking a woman's breasts while she arches back in ecstasy. Tam drops it quickly and looks up to see the Priestess watching him.",

"‘‘It’s cold here,’’ she says. It is space-cold though the heat circuits of his suit are at maximum. The pods look warm, still warmer if two people were in one… She looks like a naked woman covered with  a  thin red silk  cloak, fragile  and crumbling. He can see the faint chitin-like smoothness  of her skin, the sign of the spacehabbed. Her breath does not smock in the cold; the  moisture is being captured and recirculated. <br><br> Emperor’s Daughter. In memory he can still see the  green glow and his answering red one.<br><br> ‘‘Put some more clothes on,’’ he says  roughly. He tosses a thick jacket from one f=of the storage bays across to her, as if that would change things. ‘‘ I'm going to check the controls. We need air and heat.’’ ",

"Tam Rosse takes the lead pilot's seat and look for the controls.<br><br> Almost as soon as they turn on, the oxygen depletion alarm starts wailing. Like the recycling algae on Tam’s ship, the algae here are dead. <br><br> The yellow puff-of-air icon on Tam’s faceplate screen is blinking faster. As he watches it, it brightens and glows steadily, and a smaller wailing tone starrs up in the suit’s internal comm. ",

"The Priestess slips into the pilot’s seat next to him. <br><br> You can get along without air for a while. I can’t <br><br> Watch me die, lady, rather than sleep with you. <br><br> ‘‘I’ve got to find air,’’ Tam says",

"Oxygen starvation swoops at him like a big dark fist… <br><br> He is lying on a transparent surface… his throat and lungs ach for air, but there’s no air here… He has to breath… he can see darkness and stars. His faceplate is gon. … On Circe … at end of shift, Tam stayed behind, trying for his first escape… ‘‘ Fool, don’t you know they cycle the are when the count’s short?’’<br><br> Something digs into his hip, the lasergun. They are in the horizator, halfway between the troop carrier and the nearest entry port. <br><br> Too far away–   ",

"Air, he mouths desperately . Not enough. <br><br> She’s bending over him. Emperor’s Daughter. ‘‘Breathe from me,’’ she says, ‘‘I can give you air,’’ and puts her mouth over his in a soft-lipped kiss. ‘‘I can spacehab you.’’  ",

// No…

"He pushes her away. <br><br> The empire won’t win… won’t win…<br><br> The darkness strengthens around him. ",

"His body decides for him. His bursting lings open and he gasps. <br><br> Almost immediately her black magic begins to work on him. The smell of her, that Earth smell, growing things, it grows in him too, as insidious as cancer, scattered all through him like seeds. He holds his breath to try to stop it, but his lungs breathe  for him, his body pushes him aside and works on its own. <br><br> They gasp in rhythm, she pushes breath into his lungs, he pushes back against her breasts, but he can’t stop her. <br><br> His hands begin caressing her breasts, the soft inside of her thighs. She is body to body with him, mouth to mouth, groin to groin.",

"They are breathing in rhythm now, matched in struggle. He’s laughin gbecause he can’t believe what they’re doing, because he’sso afraid, so overwhelmed by sexual need for her, he doesn’t know where it’s coming from. Inside his skintite he is rigid and aching. He touches the skintite and the front falls open, he pushes himself inside her, pulsing with her warmth, gasping… <br><br> This isn’t happening to me <br><br> I  can’t help myself– ",

"He screams<br><br> and is  drained,<br><br> he is released, <br> let go, abandoned. ",

"The horizator is still, lying in the lee of a small meteorite that has become part of the Nii’s cargo hold. Tam is lying on the floor against the warmth of the Priestess.<br><br> She sleeps like an ordinary woman. Ordinarily warm and soft. <br><br> He feels a terrible tenderness for her. He must give her his protection. He needs to be with her always. The smell of  their sex is in the air– the smell– it’s the key to something about himself he didn’t even know, he needs to have it, he needs to rub the smell of her over himself…<br><br> And another part of he mind screams. <br><br> ‘‘So you got what you wanted,’’ he whispers, forcing his bitterness to fight against his need for her. ",

"She moves in her sleep but doesn’t wake.<br><br> Do the other Red Kings hate the women they serve? <br><br> He has his hearthsblood dagger in his hand… ",

"He tries.<br><br> He tries. <br><br> His hand turns the dagger towards his own chest. <br><br> The dagger falls out of his  hand. <br><br> She has changed him. <br><br> He is hers. ",

"Let out the air. The horizator’s airvent is high, near the ceiling. He punches out the correct sequence. <br><br> There is a whine, then the sudden intense deafness that means vacuum in space.<br><br> Instead of the jolt he expects, the horizator hardly moves. He looks at the digital readout.<br><br> Zero.<br><br> No air, no pressure. ",

"He should be dead.<br><br> His  sin chills. <br><br> He  exhales:  no plume of moisture. He  inhales. In vacuum. <br><br> Of course. She spacehabs her lovers, doesn’t she? The better  to have them die for her. <br><br> But that was fast? Changed that fast to what she needed?",

"He shakes her. She opens her eyes. Somehow she is older now. She  looks  straight into his  eyes. He  holds himself back dizzily from falling diip into  them, from  simply accepting whatever  she has for him. <br><br> ‘‘ You screwed me and spacehabbed me.’’ He hears his own  voice tinny through  his suit controls.  She replies in the same wavelength. <br><br> ‘‘You’re more in danger now. Brady told Nii to  kill  you after I had you.’’ <br><br> ‘‘After I  had you…’  Fuck the Emperor’s Mother! Didn’t I have anything to say about it?’’<br><br> She shakes her head. ‘‘No.’’ ",

"‘‘So you thought I’d be happy once I did it. Did you persuade yourself that I’d be a happy little kickass fo the Emperor, once I’d screwed you? How long before I lose my memory? Before I think I always loved the Emperor? And you?’’ <br><br> She shakes  her  head again. ",

" ‘‘You’ve  killed me!’’ he  crise out. He  raises his  hand  to  her  but he can’t strike her, and the  knowledge that  he can  never strike  her makes him turn and drive  his strong Red  King guardian fist at the horizator wall, again and  again. It makes only a jar, no sound. ",

"He slumps against the horizator  wall. She  moves to  touch  him. He jerks away.  ",

"‘‘I’m going to reprogram the ship,’’ she says.<br><br> ‘‘For  the Emperor. Go on. Go ahead.’’ <br><br> She  touches the horixator control  panel. Under her fingers  it changes. Rows of  buttons, some dark, some blinking orange, a surprising few their normal  colors  of  blue and green. ",

"‘‘See what you can find to help us.’’ <br><br> Oh yes, Mistress, I hear and obey ",

"‘‘Tis is all Terran propaganda,’’ Tam Rosse says.<br><br> The Priestess turns briefly to look at the wall. <br><br> ‘‘Give it my clearance number. AP7829044P’’ ",

"This  time there’s only one line.<br><br> Encyclopedia Galactica:  index (entries  selection as immediately relevant) <br><br> ‘‘Nicholsun’s Plague’’ *** CLASSIFIED MATERIAL  – TERRANS ONLY***   ",

"Nicholsun’s Virus or Plague<br><br> The origin of the Nicholsun’s Virus, or Nicholsun’s  Plague, is  to be  found  in  the genetics of small populations. Without intervention, small populations rapidly lose genetic identity with their  ancestors. To maintain a common  geen pool, breeding programs and mutation control are vital,  especially  in area if high background radiation, Crossbreeding is also a necessity.<br><br> During the early stages of the settlement of the Astroids, it  was  realized that genetic updating would become a necessary part of the  health of each Asteroid  ITC. ",

"About sixty-five years ago a man named Harry Nicholsun bid for and received the contract to update the ITC’s genetic pool. It  was a hazardous job, because it often meant being exposed to, and exposing other to, new diseases, as well  as introducing new genes into  the pool. <br><br> On the surface, Nicholsun’s contribution to the  Asteroid culture  seemed innocuous  if a little crude. Nicholsun  was fortunate to start his business at the time  when live pronographic theater was bein greplaced by  3D sense-linked vids (illusions). He could call on a wide range of live-theater actors, most of  whom would go  anywhere and do  anything.<br><br> Nicholsun linked genetic distribution to sex. ",

"Nicholsun  Raves began with Prayer and ceremonies, feasting, intoxication, and fireworks; they ended in mass celebration and the spread of new germplasm throughout  the ship. Their ceremonial center was the Priestess, a nubile, sensual woman who performed nacked except for her sacred glowing tattoos. Her consort was the Red Man or Red King. Invariably a condemned criminal, the Red King was chosen for his strength, sill with weapons, adn virility, and was bound to the Priestess for life by ‘‘secret ceremonies.’’ <br><br> Drawn from the uneducated parts of society and cut off from Terran culture by the sterility of the Asteroids, Asteroid dwellers eagerly sought the color and excitement that ‘‘Great-day’’ provided. A few comparatively sophisticated minds thought they saw through to Nicholsun’s secret. For them, the priestess and her Consort were simply and assistant genetic  engineer and her bodyguard. Of course – until  far too late – they did not see wah Nicholsun was doing at all.",

"More surprisingly, of the Terran officials who dealt  with Nicholsun, only one suspected this treachery. Lieut. Gregor Marczak, a minor official in the Genetics Bureau on Pallas, realized the  truth when he observed  his own extreme emotional reaction to a Priestess’s visit in San-gatsu 867.<br><br> Nicholsun had  not merely distributed genetic material; he had changed it. He had contaminated almost the  entire genetic pool of the Asteroids with a sensitivity to a rho-pheromone he himself had engineered.  <br><br> Nicholsun  pioneered the concept of pheromonic linkage.",

"His terrible plot depended on two linked stages of infection. The first generation of victims were infected by a rhinovirus, which modified cells in the nasopharyngeal passages. The  modified cells responded strongly to a kingship pheromone, developed by Nicholsun  and  given  off by his  genetically modified  Priestesses and Red Kings. Stem cells were not affected and, as the modified cells died, the effect eventually wore off.  But  the virus remained among the Asteroids, modifying itself like a cold  virus, so that the population was subject to  frequent reinfections.<br><br> The second infection was more insidious and more lasting. It entered the body through sexual contact and lived silently in the blood. On the first generation it had no apparent effect. But insidiously, in sperm and egg, it altered the very genetics of the population. On the children of  the first generation, it produced the same effect as the rhinovirus and on the first. <br><br> Permanently. ",

"The effect on the victims was blind, loving loyalty to Nicholsun and all of his subordinates– who were genetically modified to emit the rho-pheromone, but who could not  pass that modification. <br><br> In other words, Nicholsun had created a new species, a race of workers genetically engineered for loyalty. Red Kings  were pheromonically linked to their Priestesses. Priestesses and Kings, in turn, were pheromonicalyy linked to Nicholsun himself. <br><br> Smell is an unanswerable argument. The  rhinocephalon, the part of the brain governing smell, is one of the oldest parts of the brain, unchanged since the reptiles. No one could resist a Priestess or a Red King. Intellectual convictions, no matter how sincerely held, simply made no difference.  During the Riots  of 869, infected Terran officials laid down their lives to protect anti-Terran Priestesses and Red Kings. Ironically, one of those was Marczak himself, shot for treason. ",

"Nicholsun was executed at Castra Martis in 873. But by the time his ultimate treachery was punished, the modifications had spread too far. Most of  the adults thin living on the Asteroid Stations were carriers. All so their children- and Nucholsun’s raves had produced many children– carried the genetic plague. <br><br> Now, incapable of democracy, incapable of rational thought, when their rulers are present, the populations of the Asteroids live in limbo. The plague has expressed  itself in three generations of these unfortunate beings. The Asteroid population has been allowed to  drop precipitously. <br><br> The large Hermes-Eccentric cargo ships, once the lifeblood of the Asteroids, have almost all been moved to Sunward orbits, sense Asteroids trade involves the risk of genetic contamination.",

"Unless the Plague is cured, all of the population of the Asteroids  will be  allowed  to die. <br><br> The  most stringent  precautions are taken  to avoid contact between the true Terran stock  and  the Asteroid dwellers, who can  merely be called humanlike. These necessary precautions  have led to  several Nicholsun alone, is to blame for these deaths. <br><br> Ironically, Nicholsun’s false ‘‘religion’’ is now the only hope for the Asteroid dwellers. Terran technology has made the role of Priestesses and Red Kings a benevolent one. The  Priestess, moving from asteroid  to dying asteroid, is now a terran genetic techneition , carrying with her the latest experimental  weapons against Nicholsun’s plague. Today she is pheromonically linked, not  to a mad dictator, but to the Terran bureaucracy and  to the welfare of  the ship or outpost she serves.  ",

"She and her Red King,  still her protector in these wild  outposts, link her Asteroid  swellers genetically with their Terran  cousins. Operation Asteroid. They  add all improvements to algae, flora, fauna– all the benefits  of  continuing Terran  arcocultue– to the arcology of  each Asteroid. <br><br> Up to  the present. No one has  found a way of  reversing the effects of Nicholsun’s plague. But the search continues. Someday the Asteroid  dwellers will be freed of this curse. Someday they will be full members of the human race again. ",
