      <h3>Politics</h3>  <br>
     
        KING OF SPACE is set in our solar system, which is partially colonized and is divided into three parts. The inner ring of planets--Mars, Venus and Earth, known as the Terrans--are all colonized. (Mercury is uninhabited.) The Terran solspace is 
        also intensively occupied by space habitats  Some of these are 
        owned by governments or corporations, some are ITCs (Independent Trading Corporations). The Terrans are governed "democratically"
        under an emperor, who is a spiritual as well as a political leader. (See under "Religion.") <br>
        
        From Jupiter onward is the Io-Europa complex (the "Land of Ghosts‚Äù ) , supposedly under control of the Terrans, but actually in revolt. The Io-Europa complex does its own mining and manufacturing, but largely to serve its own needs; there is no trade between it and the Terrans. In the Rocks there are rumors that the Io-Europa Complex has let its genetic pool drift and that the IECs are no longer fully human. <br>
        
        Between the Terrans and the Land of Ghosts is the enormous solspace of the Asteroid Belt. 690 billion square miles in cross-section," the Rocks" is very thinly populated. <br>
        
        It is also quarantined in order to stop the spread of a viral infection unleashed by a man named Harry Nicholsun, some fifty years ago. For the story behind that quarantine, see pages 306-310 of the manuscript. <br>
        
        The effect of the Nicholsun Plague is to induce a mindless loyalty to two classes of priests, the Priestesses and the Red Kings. <br>
        
        <h3>Religion</h3> <br>
        
        The religion practiced in the Belt is built around genetic community and fertility, real issues in a scattered group of small populations. <br>
        
        The Emperor is the spiritual leader of the Terran Empire. He incarnates the fertility of the race. <br>
        
        By impregnating Space (if you believe what you hear in the Scriptures), the Emperor created his Daughter, the Priestess. Priestesses are the higher of the two religious orders. Their job is to distribute genetic material and maintain environments (arcocultures) in the scattered locations where humans live in the Asteroids. <br>
        
        These women are taken into first orders as young as three or four years old. In the Mother-house on Pallas they are trained in arcoculture, genetic distribution, simple genetic engineering, ship maintenance, and the sexual arts. Their bodies are modified with nanocomputers and other genetic modifications, including space habituation (see page 300-302). They are prepared to understand and modify the programming of the ships they will work on. They are physically modified to look like Priestesses: beautiful women with dark skin that is scattered with luminescent stars. <br>
        
        They give off a pheromone that induces sexual attraction and devotion. This is their most important modification. <br>
        
        As virgins,they wear a sickle-shapedsilver earring in one ear. <br>
        
        On her first assignment, a Priestess is ceremoniallydeflowere.d This is the Ceremony, the central action of KING OF SPACE. She officially becomes a fertile woman and may become pregnant. Her sickle earring is removed, triggering hormonal changes, which trigger some of the nanocomputers. The Priestess "comes into her full powers."  She has access to and can modify all the programing of the ship; she can make any change in the environment; and she can communicate with the ship. <br>
         
        From then on, the Priestess is principally a genetic and arcological engineer. She moves from ship to ship, maintaining the genetic pool and the arcological balance. <br>
        
        However, she also participates in every genetic distribution ceremony, having sex with many men.  She is literally a sex goddess.1. <br> 
         
        Individual Priestes es choose the members of the lower religious order, the Red Kings. Red Kings serve the Priestesses as bodyguards, gofers, and lovers. When a Priestess has sex with a man, she can decide to make him a Red King. He becomes permanently devoted to her; he also receives from her some neurogenetic modifications that make him faster, stronger, and partially space-habituated. It is considered the civilized thing to ask the man first, but frequently men have been made Red Kings against their will.<br> 
        
        Red Kings are chosen for youth, strength, and handsomeness. 
        Often they are young convicts or ex-convicts. They dress in red, which is also the convict color. Their duties include distributing geneti9 material, as the Priestess does, by having sex with as many women as possible <br>
        
        Some men are trained by their ITCs to be Red Kings. They are presented to a Priestess as, as it were, a kind of welcoming gift when she arrives at the ITC. Brady was trained in this way but was never presented.<br>
        
        <h3>Trade, Economics, and Entertainment </h3><br>
        
        The principal Terran export to the Rocks is genetic material, on which Terra has a monopoly. It is a religious duty to accept and use new genetic material in order to maintain the common gene pool.<br>
        
        Export is handled through the Priestesses. The priesthood is maintained (in style, on one of the largest asteroids) through the revenues from genetic updating. <br>
        
        The material on the Nicholsun uprising, pp. 306-310 of the manuscript, explains how genetic updates are done. <br>
        
        The second export from t e Terrans to the Rocks is entertainment. Again, Terra itself is the exporter. The entertainment is in the form of "illusions," sensory hallucinations. Illusions are used not only as traditional entertainment but to change the appearance of persons, to make habitats appear larger and more beautiful than they are, and to provide companionship. The Lady Nii becomes Andrew Brady's lover in the form of an illusion. <br>
        (Illusions, of course, also socialize people to accept the Terran culture and Terran appearances as the norm.) <br>
        
        Trade in physical objects is less profitable than trade in entertainment, desighs, and ideas, but there is considerable trade within the Terrans. The trade ships are known as "greatships", described on pp. Their only fixed assets are a central computer and an orbit. Everything else is in modules that can be plugged in and out at will. <br>
        
        Trade used to be carried on in orbits that crossed between the Terrans and the Asteroids. These orbits have become valueless since the quarantine. The Lady Nii was in one of these orbits. She was abandoned, with the infected people aboard her, at the time of the Plague. <br>
        
        Andrew Brady is the only survivor of those people and the only inhabitant of the Nii.<br>
