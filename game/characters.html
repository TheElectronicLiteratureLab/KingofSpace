                            Point-of-view character for three out of the five story lines. He is twenty-three, an airvent repairman who is not sympathetic to official Terran religion. He got involved in the Uprising (sorry, Jon), a Belt-based movement for independence, and was imprisoned in the cold mines on Circe. He has recently escaped. He is young, handsome, tough, and a little sullen.

                            The intelligence of the Greatship. She appears in the bodies of cargo waldoes and guard robots and in illusory form as a Japanese woman, young or old. She also speaks mentally with the Priestess and King Brady, who are directly linked with her. She may appear in several guises at once. Sometimes she is devoted to the principles of Terran religion, sometimes she is bitterly critical of them. She took her name from a Japanese noblewoman in the Heike Monogatari who drowned herself, holding her infant Emperor, after the disastrous battle of Lake Biwa.

                            As a young man in the service of the Lady Nii, he prepared to be a Red King. But when Nicholsun’s Plagqe broke out and the Nii was found to be an infected area, Brady was left on the semi-abandoned ship with the rest of the plague-stricken. That was fifty years ago. He is the last survivor.

Responding to a distress signal set by people long dead, her ship has diverted itself to service the hulk-Greatship, the Lady Nii. She is anticipating the Ceremony, which will give her her full powers.
